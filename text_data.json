        "wikipedia_text": "Quantum mechanics is the fundamental physical theory that describes the behavior of matter and of light; its unusual characteristics typically occur at and below the scale of atoms.: 1.1  It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.\n\nQuantum mechanics can describe many systems that classical physics cannot. Classical physics can describe many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic and (optical) microscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at very small submicroscopic (atomic and subatomic) scales. Classical mechanics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation that is valid at ordinary scales.\n\nQuantum systems have bound states that are quantized to discrete values of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities, in contrast to classical systems where these quantities can be measured continuously. Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).",
        "ai_text": "Quantum mechanics, developed in the early 20th century, revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world, challenging classical physics’ deterministic nature. It emerged from efforts to explain phenomena such as black-body radiation and the photoelectric effect, leading to the formulation of key principles and theories.\n\nAt its core, quantum mechanics introduces the concept of wave-particle duality, where particles exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties. This duality is exemplified by experiments such as the double-slit experiment, which demonstrates that light and matter can interfere like waves, yet still be detected as distinct particles.\n\nCentral to quantum mechanics is the principle of superposition, whereby a quantum system can exist in multiple states simultaneously until measured. The act of measurement collapses this superposition into a definite state, a phenomenon famously described by the Copenhagen interpretation. The uncertainty principle, articulated by Werner Heisenberg, further highlights inherent limitations in predicting a particle's position and momentum simultaneously.\n\nQuantum mechanics not only provides a theoretical framework for understanding atomic and subatomic behavior but also leads to groundbreaking technologies, including semiconductors and quantum computing, promising a future of unprecedented capabilities and insights into the nature of reality.",

Special relativity applies to all physical phenomena in the absence of gravity. General relativity explains the law of gravitation and its relation to the forces of nature. It applies to the cosmological and astrophysical realm, including astronomy.\n\nThe theory transformed theoretical physics and astronomy during the 20th century, superseding a 200-year-old theory of mechanics created primarily by Isaac Newton. It introduced concepts including 4-dimensional spacetime as a unified entity of space and time, relativity of simultaneity, kinematic and gravitational time dilation, and length contraction. In the field of physics, relativity improved the science of elementary particles and their fundamental interactions, along with ushering in the nuclear age. With relativity, cosmology and astrophysics predicted extraordinary astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars, black holes, and gravitational waves.\n\nDevelopment and acceptance",
        "ai_text": "The Theory of Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century, revolutionized our understanding of space, time, and gravity. It comprises two main components: special relativity and general relativity. Special relativity, introduced in 1905, postulates that the laws of physics are the same for all non-accelerating observers and reveals that the speed of light is constant, regardless of the observer's motion. This theory led to groundbreaking concepts such as time dilation and the equivalence of mass and energy, famously encapsulated in the equation E=mc².\n\nIn 1915, Einstein expanded these ideas with general relativity, which describes gravity not as a force but as the curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. This theory has been confirmed through numerous experiments and observations, such as the bending of light around massive celestial bodies. Together, the Theory of Relativity has profoundly influenced modern physics, reshaping our comprehension of the universe and laying the foundation for advancements in cosmology and astrophysics.",

        "wikipedia_text": "CRISPR () (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea. Each sequence within an individual prokaryotic cell is derived from a DNA fragment of a bacteriophage that had previously infected the prokaryote or one of its ancestors. These sequences are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e. anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of heritable, acquired immunity. CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.\n\nCas9 (or \"CRISPR-associated protein 9\") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and open up specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence. Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within living organisms. This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases. The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.\n\nHistory",

Originally discovered in bacteria as a defense mechanism against viruses, CRISPR has been adapted for widespread use in various fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biology.\n\nThe CRISPR system utilizes a guide RNA to target specific DNA sequences, allowing the Cas9 enzyme to create a double-strand break. This break can then be repaired through naturally occurring cellular mechanisms, providing opportunities for gene insertion, deletion, or alteration. The simplicity and efficiency of CRISPR have made it a popular tool among researchers and scientists globally.\n\nIn medicine, CRISPR holds promise for treating genetic disorders, cancers, and infectious diseases by enabling precise targeting of faulty genes. In agriculture, it is being used to create genetically modified crops that are more resilient to pests, disease, and environmental stresses. However, the technology raises ethical concerns, particularly regarding germline editing and potential unintended consequences.\n\nAs genome-editing continues to advance, rigorous guidelines and regulations are essential to ensure responsible use and to address the moral implications of altering the genetic makeup of living organisms.

        "title": "Black hole",
        "wikipedia_text": "A black hole is a massive, compact astronomical object so dense that its gravity prevents anything from escaping, even light. Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. A black hole has a great effect on the fate and circumstances of an object crossing it, but has no locally detectable features according to general relativity. In many ways, a black hole acts like an ideal black body, as it reflects no light.  Quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts that event horizons emit Hawking radiation, with the same spectrum as a black body of a temperature inversely proportional to its mass. This temperature is of the order of billionths of a kelvin for stellar black holes, making it essentially impossible to observe directly.\n\nObjects whose gravitational fields are too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace. In 1916, Karl Schwarzschild found the first modern solution of general relativity that would characterise a black hole. Due to his influential research, the Schwarzschild metric is named after him. David Finkelstein, in 1958, first published the interpretation of \"black hole\" as a region of space from which nothing can escape. Black holes were long considered a mathematical curiosity; it was not until the 1960s that theoretical work showed they were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars by Jocelyn Bell Burnell in 1967 sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality. The first black hole known was Cygnus X-1, identified by several researchers independently in 1971.\n\nBlack holes typically form when massive stars collapse at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed, it can grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. Supermassive black holes of millions of solar masses (M☉) may form by absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, or via direct collapse of gas clouds. There is consensus that supermassive black holes exist in the centres of most galaxies.",
        "ai_text": "A black hole is one of the most fascinating and mysterious phenomena in the universe, representing a region in space where gravitational forces are so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. This intense gravitational pull is the result of a massive star exhausting its nuclear fuel and undergoing gravitational collapse, compressing its mass into an incredibly small volume.\n\nThe boundary surrounding a black hole is known as the event horizon. Once an object crosses this threshold, it cannot return. Black holes can vary in size, with stellar black holes formed from the remnants of massive stars, usually several times the mass of our Sun, and supermassive black holes, which can possess millions to billions of solar masses and are typically found at the centers of galaxies, including our Milky Way.\n\nThe study of black holes has significantly advanced over the last few decades, particularly with the advent of powerful telescopes and gravitational wave detectors. One of the most groundbreaking moments in astrophysics was the first direct image of a black hole’s event horizon, captured by the Event Horizon Telescope in 2019. This monumental achievement provided visual evidence supporting the existence of black holes and validated several predictions made by Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity.\n\nBlack holes are not just cosmic vacuum cleaners; they play a critical role in the evolution of galaxies. Supermassive black holes can influence star formation and the distribution of matter in their host galaxies. Their immense gravitational pull can lead to the formation of accretion disks—disks of gas and dust spiraling inward, which emit X-rays and other radiation as they are heated to extreme temperatures.\n\nWhile black holes may seem enigmatic, they also fuel a wealth of scientific inquiry. From understanding the fundamental laws of physics to exploring the nature of space and time, black holes continue to intrigue scientists and the public alike. As research progresses, they may hold the key to unlocking further mysteries of the universe.",

        "title": "Renewable energy",
        "wikipedia_text": "Renewable energy (also called green energy) is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries. Some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source, although this is controversial, as nuclear energy requires mining uranium, a nonrenewable resource. Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas. Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification. This has several benefits: electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption. Variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature, such as wind power and solar power. In contrast, controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity, bioenergy, or geothermal power.\n\nRenewable energy systems have rapidly become more efficient and cheaper over the past 30 years. A large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity is now renewable. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have seen significant cost reductions over the past decade, making them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels. In most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity. From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy grew from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply. Power from the sun and wind accounted for most of this increase, growing from a combined 2% to 10%. Use of fossil energy shrank from 68% to 62%. In 2022, renewables accounted for 30% of global electricity generation and are projected to reach over 42% by 2028. Many countries already have renewables contributing more than 20% of their total energy supply, with some generating over half or even all their electricity from renewable sources.\n\nThe main motivation to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources is to slow and eventually stop climate change, which is widely agreed to be caused mostly by greenhouse gas emissions. In general, renewable energy sources cause much lower emissions than fossil fuels. The International Energy Agency estimates that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources. Renewables also cause much less air pollution than fossil fuels, improving public health, and are less noisy.",
        "ai_text": "Renewable energy refers to energy derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. This includes sources like solar, wind, hydro, geothermal, and biomass. As we confront the accelerating impacts of climate change and the depletion of fossil fuels, renewable energy has emerged as a critical component of sustainable development and environmental conservation.\n\nOne of the foremost advantages of renewable energy is its minimal environmental impact compared to traditional fossil fuels. Burning coal, oil, and gas releases significant carbon emissions, contributing to global warming and air pollution. In contrast, renewable energy sources produce little to no greenhouse gases during operation, making them essential in the pursuit of carbon neutrality. For instance, solar panels harness sunlight to generate electricity without emitting harmful pollutants, while wind turbines convert wind energy into power without creating waste.\n\nMoreover, the adoption of renewable energy technologies is becoming increasingly cost-effective. The costs associated with solar and wind energy have plummeted over the past decade due to technological advancements and economies of scale. According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), solar photovoltaic (PV) and onshore wind energy are now among the cheapest sources of electricity globally, providing a strong incentive for nations to transition to cleaner energy systems. \n\nAdditionally, renewable energy enhances energy security and diversity. By utilizing a variety of energy sources, countries can reduce their dependence on imported fuels, which can fluctuate in price and availability. This diversification strengthens national energy portfolios and promotes resilience against geopolitical tensions and supply disruptions. \n\nRenewable energy also stimulates job creation and economic growth. The sector has already generated millions of jobs worldwide, from manufacturing and installation to maintenance and research. As the global energy landscape continues to evolve, investment in renewable technologies is poised to create even more employment opportunities, particularly in regions that have historically relied on fossil fuel industries.\n\nDespite the many benefits, the transition to renewable energy is not without challenges. Energy storage, grid integration, and the need for supportive policy frameworks are critical to overcoming these hurdles. However, with persistent innovation and commitment from governments, businesses, and communities, renewable energy stands as a beacon of hope in creating a more sustainable, equitable, and environmentally-friendly future.

The Internet Protocol Suite, the set of rules used to communicate between networks and devices on the Internet, arose from research and development in the United States and involved international collaboration, particularly with researchers in the United Kingdom and France.\n\nComputer science was an emerging discipline in the late 1950s that began to consider time-sharing between computer users, and later, the possibility of achieving this over wide area networks. J. C. R. Licklider developed the idea of a universal network at the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) of the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). Independently, Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation proposed a distributed network based on data in message blocks in the early 1960s, and Donald Davies conceived of packet switching in 1965 at the National Physical Laboratory (NPL), proposing a national commercial data network in the United Kingdom.\n\nARPA awarded contracts in 1969 for the development of the ARPANET project, directed by Robert Taylor and managed by Lawrence Roberts. ARPANET adopted the packet switching technology proposed by Davies and Baran. The network of Interface Message Processors (IMPs) was built by a team at Bolt, Beranek, and Newman, with the design and specification led by Bob Kahn. The host-to-host protocol was specified by a group of graduate students at UCLA, led by Steve Crocker, along with Jon Postel and others.

        "title": "Fall of the Western Roman Empire",
        "wikipedia_text": "The fall of the Western Roman Empire, also called the fall of the Roman Empire or the fall of Rome, was the loss of central political control in the Western Roman Empire, a process in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided among several successor polities. The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration. Increasing pressure from invading peoples outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse. Climatic changes and both endemic and epidemic disease drove many of these immediate factors. The reasons for the collapse are major subjects of the historiography of the ancient world and they inform much modern discourse on state failure.\n\nIn 376, a large migration of Goths and other non-Roman people, fleeing from the Huns, entered the Empire. Roman forces were unable to exterminate, expel or subjugate them (as was their normal practice). In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died. He left a collapsing field army, and the Empire divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons. Goths and other non-Romans became a force that could challenge either part of the Empire. Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers. The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never again effectively consolidated.\n\nBy 476, the position of Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power, and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman. Barbarian kingdoms had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire. In 476, the Germanic barbarian king Odoacer deposed the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire in Italy, Romulus Augustulus, and the Senate sent the imperial insignia to the Eastern Roman Emperor Zeno.",
        "ai_text": "The Fall of the Western Roman Empire is a complex historical narrative marked by a gradual decline rather than a singular catastrophic event. While the empire reached its zenith in the 2nd century AD, a series of internal and external pressures led to its ultimate disintegration by the late 5th century.\n\nInternally, the Western Roman Empire faced significant political turmoil. The frequent changes in leadership, often resulting from violent coups and assassinations, weakened the central authority. Emperors were unable to maintain control over the vast territories, which became increasingly divided and fragmented. Corruption and inefficiency plagued the bureaucracy, diminishing the empire's ability to collect taxes and provide essential services. Furthermore, economic difficulties, driven by over-reliance on slave labor and inflation, contributed to a declining standard of living for many citizens.\n\nExternally, the empire was besieged by a series of invasions and migrations. Throughout the 4th and 5th centuries, various groups, including the Visigoths, Vandals, and Huns, invaded Roman territories. The Visigoths famously sacked Rome in 410 AD, marking a significant psychological blow to the empire's prestige. Meanwhile, the Huns, under the leadership of Attila, posed a formidable threat, prompting further waves of migration that destabilized the region.\n\nThe division of the Roman Empire into Eastern and Western halves in 285 AD by Emperor Diocletian further exacerbated these issues. While the Eastern Roman Empire, later known as the Byzantine Empire, continued to thrive, the Western Empire struggled to cope with its multifaceted crises. The official transfer of power to the Germanic king Odoacer in 476 AD, when the last emperor, Romulus Augustulus, was deposed, is often cited as the endpoint of the Western Roman Empire.\n\nDespite the fall of political authority, the legacy of Rome endured in the form of cultural, legal, and architectural influences. The fragmentation of the empire paved the way for the emergence of medieval Europe, reshaping the continent's future and firmly embedding Roman heritage in Western civilization.",

        "title": "Cold War",
        "wikipedia_text": "The Cold War was a period of global geopolitical rivalry between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union (USSR) and their respective allies, the capitalist Western Bloc and communist Eastern Bloc, which lasted from 1947 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The term cold war is used because there was no direct fighting between the two superpowers, though each supported opposing sides in regional conflicts known as proxy wars. In addition to the struggle for ideological and economic influence and an arms race in both conventional and nuclear weapons, the Cold War was expressed through technological rivalries such as the Space Race, espionage, propaganda campaigns, embargoes, and sports diplomacy.\n\nAfter the end of World War II in 1945, during which the US and USSR had been allies, the USSR installed satellite governments in its occupied territories in Eastern Europe and North Korea by 1949, resulting in the political division of Europe (and Germany) by an \"Iron Curtain\". The USSR tested its first nuclear weapon in 1949, four years after their use by the US at Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and allied with the People's Republic of China, founded in 1949. The US declared the Truman Doctrine of \"containment\" of communism in 1947, launched the Marshall Plan in 1948 to assist Western Europe's economic recovery, and founded the NATO military alliance in 1949 (matched by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact in 1955). The Berlin Blockade of 1948 to 1949 was an early confrontation, as was the Korean War of 1950 to 1953, which ended in a stalemate. \n\nUS involvement in regime change during the Cold War included support for anti-communist and right-wing dictatorships and uprisings, while Soviet involvement included the funding of left-wing parties, wars of independence, and dictatorships. As nearly all the colonial states underwent decolonization, many became Third World battlefields of the Cold War. Both powers used economic aid in an attempt to win the loyalty of non-aligned countries. The Cuban Revolution of 1959 installed the first communist regime in the Western Hemisphere, and in 1962, the Cuban Missile Crisis began after deployments of US missiles in Europe and Soviet missiles in Cuba; it is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into nuclear war. Another major proxy conflict was the Vietnam War of 1955 to 1975, which ended in defeat for the US. ",
        "ai_text": "The Cold War, a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States along with their respective allies, spanned approximately four decades from the end of World War II in 1947 until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This era was marked by a profound ideological clash between capitalism and communism, leading to a world seemingly divided into two distinct spheres of influence.\n\nFollowing World War II, the United States emerged as a global superpower, advocating for democratic governance and capitalist economics. In contrast, the Soviet Union sought to promote communism, emphasizing state control and a classless society. The two powers engaged in a fierce battle for ideological supremacy, resulting in a series of proxy wars, political intrigues, and military build-ups.\n\nOne of the defining characteristics of the Cold War was the nuclear arms race. Both superpowers amassed vast arsenals of nuclear weapons, leading to a precarious balance of power known as Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD). The fear of a nuclear conflict loomed large, influencing military and foreign policies on both sides. The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 proved to be a critical moment, where a direct confrontation nearly escalated into a nuclear war, underscoring the tension and mistrust between the two nations.\n\nThe Cold War was also marked by significant events such as the Berlin Blockade, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, which showcased the global ramifications of the ideological confrontation. In Europe, the Berlin Wall became a powerful symbol of the ideological divide, separating West Berlin, a capitalist enclave, from East Berlin, a communist stronghold. Countries were often caught in the crossfire, coerced into aligning with either superpower for economic or military support.\n\nAs the decades progressed, the Cold War paradoxically led to advancements in technology and space exploration. The space race, highlighted by the Soviet launch of Sputnik in 1957 and the U.S. moon landing in 1969, ignited national pride and technological innovation.\n\nUltimately, the Cold War began to wane in the late 1980s with the rise of reformist leader Mikhail Gorbachev in the Soviet Union, whose policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) aimed to modernize the economy but inadvertently destabilized communist control. The fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 symbolized the decline of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe, leading to the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 and marking the end of the Cold War era.",

        "title": "French Revolution",
        "wikipedia_text": "The French Revolution (French: Révolution française [ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz]) was a period of political and societal change in France which began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the Coup of 18 Brumaire on 9 November 1799. Many of the revolution's ideas are considered fundamental principles of liberal democracy, and its values remain central to modern French political discourse.\n\nThe causes of the revolution were a combination of social, political, and economic factors which the ancien régime (\"old regime\") proved unable to manage. A financial crisis and widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General in May 1789, its first meeting since 1614. The representatives of the Third Estate broke away and re-constituted themselves as a National Assembly in June. The Storming of the Bastille in Paris on 14 July was followed by radical measures by the Assembly, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control over the Catholic Church, and a declaration of rights. The next three years were dominated by a struggle for political control. King Louis XVI's attempted flight to Varennes in June 1791 further discredited the monarchy, and military defeats after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792 led to an armed insurrection on 10 August 1792. The monarchy was replaced by the French First Republic in September, and Louis XVI was executed in January 1793.\n\nAfter another revolt in June 1793, the constitution was suspended, and political power passed from the National Convention to the Committee of Public Safety, dominated by radical Jacobins led by Maximilien Robespierre. About 16,000 people were sentenced by the Revolutionary Tribunal and executed in the Reign of Terror, which ended in July 1794 with the Thermidorian Reaction. Weakened by external threats and internal opposition, the Committee of Public Safety was replaced in November 1795 by the Directory. Its instability ended in the coup of 18 Brumaire and the establishment of the Consulate, with Napoleon Bonaparte as First Consul.",
        "ai_text": "The French Revolution, which began in 1789, was a period of profound social and political upheaval in France that significantly altered the course of history. Rooted in Enlightenment ideals, the Revolution arose from widespread discontent with the monarchy, social inequality, and economic hardship. The Ancien Régime, characterized by a rigid class structure, placed immense burdens on the Third Estate—comprising peasants, urban workers, and the bourgeoisie—while the First and Second Estates (clergy and nobility) enjoyed privileges and wealth.\n\nKey events during the Revolution included the convening of the Estates-General in May 1789, where the Third Estate broke away to form the National Assembly. This bold move signified a desire for political representation and power. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, became a symbol of the people’s revolt against tyranny, fueling the revolutionary spirit across France. The Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, adopted in August, articulated fundamental rights and freedoms, underlining the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity.\n\nAs the Revolution progressed, radical factions emerged, leading to increased violence and instability. The Reign of Terror, orchestrated by Maximilien Robespierre and the Committee of Public Safety, saw thousands executed by guillotine, including King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette. This tumultuous period starkly contrasted with the initial ideals of the Revolution, as fear and suspicion permeated society.\n\nBy 1799, the Revolution culminated in the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte, who established a dictatorship, bringing an end to the revolutionary fervor. Despite its chaotic nature, the French Revolution laid the groundwork for modern democratic principles and inspired movements worldwide. It challenged the notions of absolute monarchy and privilege, fundamentally transforming France and influencing global political thought for generations to come.",

        "title": "Nelson Mandela",
        "wikipedia_text": "Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela ( man-DEL-ə, Xhosa: [xolíɬaɬa mandɛ̂ːla]; born Rolihlahla Mandela; 18 July 1918 – 5 December 2013) was a South African anti-apartheid activist and politician who served as the first president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. He was the country's first black head of state and the first elected in a fully representative democratic election. His government focused on dismantling the legacy of apartheid by fostering racial reconciliation. Ideologically an African nationalist and socialist, he served as the president of the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997.\n\nA Xhosa, Mandela was born into the Thembu royal family in Mvezo, South Africa. He studied law at the University of Fort Hare and the University of Witwatersrand before working as a lawyer in Johannesburg. There he became involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist politics, joining the ANC in 1943 and co-founding its Youth League in 1944. After the National Party's white-only government established apartheid, a system of racial segregation that privileged whites, Mandela and the ANC committed themselves to its overthrow. He was appointed president of the ANC's Transvaal branch, rising to prominence for his involvement in the 1952 Defiance Campaign and the 1955 Congress of the People. He was repeatedly arrested for seditious activities and was unsuccessfully prosecuted in the 1956 Treason Trial. Influenced by Marxism, he secretly joined the banned South African Communist Party (SACP). Although initially committed to non-violent protest, in association with the SACP he co-founded the militant uMkhonto we Sizwe in 1961 that led a sabotage campaign against the apartheid government. He was arrested and imprisoned in 1962, and, following the Rivonia Trial, was sentenced to life imprisonment for conspiring to overthrow the state.\n\nMandela served 27 years in prison, split between Robben Island, Pollsmoor Prison, and Victor Verster Prison. Amid growing domestic and international pressure and fears of racial civil war, President F. W. de Klerk released him in 1990. Mandela and de Klerk led efforts to negotiate an end to apartheid, which resulted in the 1994 multiracial general election in which Mandela led the ANC to victory and became president. Leading a broad coalition government which promulgated a new constitution, Mandela emphasised reconciliation between the country's racial groups and created the Truth and Reconciliation Commission to investigate past human rights abuses. Economically, his administration retained its predecessor's liberal framework despite his own socialist beliefs, also introducing measures to encourage land reform, combat poverty and expand healthcare services. Internationally, Mandela acted as mediator in the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial and served as secretary-general of the Non-Aligned Movement from 1998 to 1999. He declined a second presidential term and was succeeded by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki. Mandela became an elder statesman and focused on combating poverty and HIV/AIDS through the charitable Nelson Mandela Foundation.",
        "ai_text": "Nelson Mandela, an iconic figure in the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, is remembered not only for his role in dismantling institutionalized racism in his country but also for his deep commitment to peace, reconciliation, and human rights on a global scale. Born on July 18, 1918, in the small village of Mvezo in the Eastern Cape, Mandela grew up in a world largely dominated by racial segregation. His early exposure to the injustices of colonial rule galvanized his resolve to seek equality for all South Africans.\n\nMandela’s political awakening took shape during his studies at the University of Fort Hare and later at the University of Witwatersrand, where he became actively involved in anti-colonial and African nationalist movements. In 1944, he joined the African National Congress (ANC), an organization committed to fighting racial oppression. As a member of the ANC, Mandela played a crucial role in orchestrating non-violent protests against apartheid policies. However, after the Sharpeville Massacre in 1960, which resulted in the deaths of 69 unarmed protestors, he advocated for armed resistance, co-founding Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the ANC.\n\nIn 1962, Mandela was arrested and subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment for his involvement in anti-apartheid activities. He spent 27 years in prison, a time during which he became a symbol of resistance against injustice, both within South Africa and internationally. The campaign to free Mandela gained momentum around the world, with calls for his release becoming a rallying cry for activists advocating for racial equality and the end of apartheid.\n\nUpon his release in 1990, Mandela emerged not just as a leader but as a unifying force for a country embroiled in conflict. His commitment to reconciliation over revenge was pivotal in preventing a civil war. He famously proclaimed that “the time for healing of the wounds has come” and worked alongside then-President F.W. de Klerk to negotiate a peaceful transition to democracy. In 1994, South Africa held its first multiracial elections, leading to Mandela being elected as the country’s first Black president. His presidency marked a new era, where he focused on nation-building and addressing the needs of those marginalized under apartheid.\n\nBeyond his political achievements, Mandela's legacy is one of compassion and humility. He founded the Nelson Mandela Foundation, which aims to promote social justice and human rights globally. After stepping down from the presidency in 1999, he continued to be a global advocate for peace, education, and health care until his passing on December 5, 2013.\n\nMandela's life is a testament to the power of resilience and the potential for transformation through dialogue and forgiveness. His story inspires countless individuals worldwide, reminding us of the ongoing fight for justice and equality.",

        "title": "Civil rights movement",
        "wikipedia_text": "The civil rights movement was a social movement in the United States from 1954 to 1968 which aimed to abolish legalized racial segregation, discrimination, and disenfranchisement in the country, which most commonly affected African Americans. The movement had origins in the Reconstruction era in the late 19th century, and modern roots in the 1940s. After years of nonviolent protests and civil disobedience campaigns, the civil rights movement achieved many of its legislative goals in the 1960s, during which it secured new protections in federal law for the civil rights of all Americans.\n\nFollowing the American Civil War (1861–1865), the three Reconstruction Amendments to the U.S. Constitution abolished slavery and granted citizenship to all African Americans, the majority of whom had recently been enslaved in the southern states. During Reconstruction, African-American men in the South voted and held political office, but after 1877 they were increasingly deprived of civil rights under racist Jim Crow laws (which for example banned interracial marriage, introduced literacy tests for voters, and segregated schools) and were subjected to violence from white supremacists during the nadir of American race relations. African Americans who moved to the North in order to improve their prospects in the Great Migration also faced barriers in employment and housing. Legal racial discrimination was upheld by the Supreme Court in its 1896 decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which established the doctrine of \"separate but equal\". The movement for civil rights, led by figures such as W. E. B. Du Bois and Booker T. Washington, achieved few gains until after World War II. In 1948, President Harry S. Truman issued an executive order abolishing discrimination in the armed forces.\n\nIn 1954, the Supreme Court struck down state laws establishing racial segregation in public schools in Brown v. Board of Education. A mass movement for civil rights, led by Martin Luther King Jr. and others, began a campaign of nonviolent protests and civil disobedience including the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955–1956, \"sit-ins\" in Greensboro and Nashville in 1960, the Birmingham campaign in 1963, and a march from Selma to Montgomery in 1965. Press coverage of events such as the lynching of Emmett Till in 1955 and the use of fire hoses and dogs against protesters in Birmingham increased public support for the civil rights movement. In 1963, about 250,000 people participated in the March on Washington, after which President John F. Kennedy asked Congress to pass civil rights legislation. Kennedy's successor, Lyndon B. Johnson, overcame the opposition of southern politicians to pass three major laws: the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in public accommodations, employment, and federally assisted programs; the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which outlawed discriminatory voting laws and authorized federal oversight of election law in areas with a history of voter suppression; and the Fair Housing Act of 1968, which banned housing discrimination. The Supreme Court made further pro–civil rights rulings in cases including Browder v. Gayle (1956) and Loving v. Virginia (1967), banning segregation in public transport and striking down laws against interracial marriage.",
        "ai_text": "The Civil Rights Movement in the United States was a pivotal era in the 20th century, emerging predominantly in the 1950s and 1960s, aimed at ending racial segregation and discrimination against African Americans. Its roots can be traced to earlier struggles for equality and justice, including the abolition movement, the Harlem Renaissance, and the efforts of civil rights advocates before World War II. However, the post-war period catalyzed a broader, more organized effort toward civil rights, driven by a growing awareness of social injustices faced by African Americans, especially in the southern states.\n\nOne of the most significant catalysts of the movement was the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which declared the doctrine of \"separate but equal\" unconstitutional, effectively desegregating public schools. This landmark ruling infused the movement with a new sense of hope and urgency, galvanizing a wide array of activists, organizations, and ordinary citizens.\n\nProminent figures emerged as leaders of the movement, with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. standing out for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance inspired by Mahatma Gandhi. King’s leadership during events such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott in 1955 showcased the power of organized, peaceful protest. The boycott was sparked by Rosa Parks' refusal to give up her bus seat to a white passenger, igniting a year-long struggle that led to a significant Supreme Court ruling against bus segregation.\n\nThe Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), co-founded by King, played a vital role in coordinating this grassroots activism. Additionally, groups like the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) energized younger activists, emphasizing direct action tactics such as sit-ins, voter registration drives, and freedom rides to confront segregation head-on. These actions helped to shine a national spotlight on the brutal realities faced by African Americans in the South.\n\nThe movement also saw the involvement of a diverse coalition of individuals and organizations, including labor unions, religious groups, and sympathetic white Americans, who rallied to the cause. Events like the March on Washington in 1963, where Dr. King delivered his iconic \"I Have a Dream\" speech, were monumental in rallying public support for civil rights legislation.\n\nLegislative victories followed the sustained pressure and activism of the Civil Rights Movement. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were landmark legislations that effectively outlawed discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and secured voting rights for African Americans.\n\nDespite these achievements, the movement faced considerable challenges, including violent backlash from segregationists and the persistence of systemic racism. The assassination of leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 marked a tragic turning point, signaling both the fragility of progress and the ongoing struggle for equality. \n\nToday, the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement continues to resonate, influencing contemporary social justice initiatives and serving as a foundation for ongoing efforts to address racial inequalities in America. The bravery and resilience of the countless individuals involved in the movement are celebrated as a vital chapter in the pursuit of justice and equality, inspiring future generations to continue the fight against oppression and discrimination.",

        "title": "History of democracy",
        "wikipedia_text": "A democracy is a political system, or a system of decision-making within an institution, organization, or state, in which members have a share of power. Modern democracies are characterized by two capabilities of their citizens that differentiate them fundamentally from earlier forms of government: to intervene in society and have their sovereign (e.g., their representatives) held accountable to the international laws of other governments of their kind. Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems, which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively.\n\nDemocracy is generally associated with the efforts of the ancient Greeks, whom 18th-century intellectuals such as Montesquieu  considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for post-monarchical political organization. The extent to which these 18th-century democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable, even if the moral justifications they often employed might be.  Nevertheless, the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the British Empire following the end of the Second World War.\n\nModern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseau's depiction of the state of nature and Hobbes's depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through 'social contracts' that enshrine the rights of the citizens, curtail the power of the state, and grant agency through the right to vote.",
        "ai_text": "The history of democracy is a rich and complex narrative that spans millennia. While the roots of democratic governance can be traced back to ancient Athens in the 5th century BCE, it was a limited form, primarily involving free male citizens. Established by leaders like Cleisthenes, Athenian democracy emphasized direct participation in decision-making, laying the groundwork for future democratic ideals.\n\nThe concept evolved throughout the ages, influencing the Roman Republic, where elected representatives played a crucial role, but ultimately fell into decline with the rise of autocratic empires. The Middle Ages saw the emergence of feudal systems, limiting individual rights and political participation. However, the Renaissance and Enlightenment periods reignited interest in democratic principles, leading to influential thinkers like John Locke and Montesquieu who championed individual liberties and the separation of powers.\n\nThe modern era of democracy began in the late 18th century with revolutions in America (1776) and France (1789), which advanced ideas of popular sovereignty and equal rights. These movements inspired a wave of democratic reforms worldwide. The 19th and 20th centuries saw significant milestones, such as the expansion of suffrage, the establishment of political parties, and the end of many colonial regimes.\n\nToday, democracy exists in various forms globally, from direct to representative systems. Despite challenges, including authoritarianism and political corruption, the ideals of democratic governance continue to inspire movements for freedom and equality, reflecting an ongoing struggle for the rights of individuals and communities alike.",

        "title": "Industrial Revolution",
        "wikipedia_text": "The Industrial Revolution, sometimes divided into the First Industrial Revolution and Second Industrial Revolution, was a transitional period of the global economy toward more widespread, efficient and stable manufacturing processes, succeeding the Second Agricultural Revolution. Beginning in Great Britain around 1760, the Industrial Revolution had spread to continental Europe and the United States by about 1840. This transition included going from hand production methods to machines; new chemical manufacturing and iron production processes; the increasing use of water power and steam power; the development of machine tools; and the rise of the mechanised factory system. Output greatly increased, and the result was an unprecedented rise in population and the rate of population growth. The textile industry was the first to use modern production methods,: 40  and textiles became the dominant industry in terms of employment, value of output, and capital invested.\n\nMany of the technological and architectural innovations were of British origin. By the mid-18th century, Britain was the world's leading commercial nation, controlling a global trading empire with colonies in North America and the Caribbean. Britain had major military and political hegemony on the Indian subcontinent; particularly with the proto-industrialised Mughal Bengal, which underwent the de-industrialisation of India through the activities of the East India Company. The development of trade and the rise of business were among the major causes of the Industrial Revolution.: 15  Developments in law also facilitated the revolution, such as courts ruling in favour of property rights. An entrepreneurial spirit and consumer revolution helped drive industrialisation in Britain, which after 1800, was emulated in Belgium, the United States, and France.\n\nThe Industrial Revolution marked a major turning point in history, comparable only to humanity's adoption of agriculture with respect to material advancement. The Industrial Revolution influenced in some way almost every aspect of daily life. In particular, average income and population began to exhibit unprecedented sustained growth. Some economists have said the most important effect of the Industrial Revolution was that the standard of living for the general population in the Western world began to increase consistently for the first time in history, although others have said that it did not begin to improve meaningfully until the late 19th and 20th centuries. GDP per capita was broadly stable before the Industrial Revolution and the emergence of the modern capitalist economy, while the Industrial Revolution began an era of per-capita economic growth in capitalist economies. Economic historians agree that the onset of the Industrial Revolution is the most important event in human history since the domestication of animals and plants.",
        "ai_text": "The Industrial Revolution, a transformative period from the late 18th to the early 19th century, marked a significant turning point in history, altering economies, societies, and cultures across the globe. This period, originating in Great Britain, was characterized by a shift from agrarian economies to industrialized ones, driven by advancements in technology and changes in production methods.\n\nAt its core, the Industrial Revolution was fueled by innovations in machinery and transportation. The introduction of the steam engine by James Watt in the late 1700s revolutionized manufacturing processes, allowing factories to operate more efficiently than ever before. This mechanization enabled the mass production of goods, dramatically increasing output while decreasing labor costs. Industries such as textiles, iron, and coal mining benefitted immensely, with textile mills and ironworks springing up in urban areas. \n\nThe prevalence of factories also spurred significant demographic shifts. As people migrated from rural areas to cities in search of work, urban centers expanded rapidly. This movement fostered new social dynamics, creating a burgeoning working class that labored long hours under often hazardous conditions for minimal wages. Child labor was rampant, with many children working in factories and mines, leading to a growing social consciousness about workers’ rights and the need for reform.\n\nIn addition to economic shifts, the Industrial Revolution catalyzed advancements in transportation and communication. The construction of railways and steamships revolutionized how goods and people moved, contributing to globalization and enhancing trade networks. The development of the telegraph, meanwhile, allowed for instant communication over long distances, effectively shrinking the world and fostering interconnectedness among nations.\n\nThe repercussions of the Industrial Revolution extended beyond economic and technological realms; it reshaped social structures and cultural landscapes. The rise of the middle class, fueled by newfound wealth from industrial enterprises, altered traditional power dynamics, eventually leading to social reforms and political movements advocating for better working conditions, education, and suffrage.\n\nHowever, the Industrial Revolution also brought significant challenges. Environmental degradation, urban overcrowding, and public health crises emerged as cities struggled to accommodate the rapid influx of workers. The disparity between the affluent and the working class widened, setting the stage for tensions that would manifest in labor movements and social upheaval.\n\nIn summary, the Industrial Revolution was a complex and multifaceted epoch that laid the groundwork for modern economic systems and society. Its legacy is evident today, as the interplay of technological advancement, urbanization, and social change continues to shape our world. Understanding this historical period is crucial to grasping the ongoing evolution of industry and society.",

        "title": "Cuban Missile Crisis",
        "wikipedia_text": "The Cuban Missile Crisis, also known as the October Crisis (Spanish: Crisis de Octubre) in Cuba, or the Caribbean Crisis (Russian: Карибский кризис, romanized: Karibskiy krizis), was a 13-day confrontation between the governments of the United States and the Soviet Union, when American deployments of nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey were matched by Soviet deployments of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis lasted from 16 to 28 October 1962. The confrontation is widely considered the closest the Cold War came to escalating into full-scale nuclear war.\n\nIn 1961 the US government put Jupiter nuclear missiles in Italy and Turkey. It had trained a paramilitary force of expatriate Cubans, which the CIA led in an attempt to invade Cuba and overthrow its government. Starting in November of that year, the US government engaged in a violent campaign of terrorism and sabotage in Cuba, referred to as the Cuban Project, which continued throughout the first half of the 1960s. The Soviet administration was concerned about a Cuban drift towards China, with which the Soviets had an increasingly fractious relationship. In response to these factors the Soviet and Cuban governments agreed, at a meeting between leaders Nikita Khrushchev and Fidel Castro in July 1962, to place nuclear missiles on Cuba to deter a future US invasion. Construction of launch facilities started shortly thereafter.\n\nA U-2 spy plane captured photographic evidence of medium- and long-range launch facilities in October. US President John F. Kennedy convened a meeting of the National Security Council and other key advisers, forming the Executive Committee of the National Security Council (EXCOMM). Kennedy was advised to carry out an air strike on Cuban soil in order to compromise Soviet missile supplies, followed by an invasion of the Cuban mainland. He chose a less aggressive course in order to avoid a declaration of war. On 22 October Kennedy ordered a naval blockade to prevent further missiles from reaching Cuba. He referred to the blockade as a \"quarantine\", not as a blockade, so the US could avoid the formal implications of a state of war.",
        "ai_text": "The Cuban Missile Crisis, a pivotal moment in Cold War history, unfolded over thirteen intense days in October 1962. It began when American reconnaissance flights over Cuba revealed that the Soviet Union was secretly installing nuclear missiles on the island, just 90 miles from the United States. This discovery sparked an unprecedented confrontation between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, heightening tensions and bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy, aware that any miscalculation could lead to catastrophic consequences, opted for a naval blockade, referred to as a \"quarantine,\" to prevent further Soviet shipments of military hardware to Cuba. On October 22, he addressed the nation, informing Americans of the situation and emphasizing the threat posed by these missiles. His measured yet firm approach aimed to demonstrate resolve without provoking a full-scale military conflict. \n\nIn the following days, the world watched anxiously as diplomatic communications between the superpowers intensified. The U.S. military was placed on high alert, and fears of an imminent war loomed large. Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev initially responded defiantly, dismissing the blockade and asserting that the U.S. would not interfere in Cuba’s sovereignty. However, both leaders understood the dire stakes of a nuclear confrontation.\n\nThe tension reached a peak on October 27, when an American U-2 spy plane was shot down over Cuba, further escalating the crisis. Yet, behind the scenes, negotiations were underway. In an effort to de-escalate, Kennedy and Khrushchev eventually reached a mutual agreement. The U.S. would publicly declare not to invade Cuba and secretly agree to dismantle its Jupiter missiles in Turkey, while the Soviets would withdraw their nuclear weapons from Cuba.\n\nThe resolution of the crisis marked a turning point, showcasing the importance of diplomacy in averting disaster. It also led to the establishment of the Moscow-Washington hotline, a direct communication link aimed at preventing future crises. The Cuban Missile Crisis remains a critical study in international relations, underscoring the fragility of peace in a world of competing superpowers.",

        "title": "World War I",
        "wikipedia_text": "World War I or the First World War (28 July 1914 – 11 November 1918), also known as the Great War, was a global conflict between two coalitions: the Allies (or Entente) and the Central Powers. Fighting took place mainly in Europe and the Middle East, as well as in parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific, and in Europe was characterised by trench warfare; the widespread use of artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons (gas); and the introductions of tanks and aircraft. World War I was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, resulting in an estimated 10 million military dead and more than 20 million wounded, plus some 10 million civilian dead from causes including genocide. The movement of large numbers of people was a major factor in the deadly Spanish flu pandemic.\n\nThe causes of World War I included the rise of Germany and decline of the Ottoman Empire, which disturbed the long-standing balance of power in Europe, and rising economic competition between nations driven by industrialisation and imperialism. Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when a Bosnian Serb assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium, and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France then transfer its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a near-continuous line of trenches from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others joined in from 1915 onward. \n\nMajor battles, including at Verdun, the Somme, and Passchendaele, failed to break the stalemate on the Western Front. In April 1917, the United States joined the Allies after Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare against Atlantic shipping. Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in the October Revolution; Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched a spring offensive in the west, which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive beginning in August 1918 caused a collapse of the German front line. By early November, Bulgaria, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary had each signed armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918.",
        "ai_text": "World War I, often referred to as the Great War, was a global conflict that lasted from 1914 to 1918 and fundamentally reshaped the world. Triggered by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary in June 1914, the war saw a complex web of alliances and hostilities draw in numerous countries, leading to an unprecedented scale of violence.\n\nThe war was primarily fought between two major alliances: the Allied Powers, which included countries like France, the United Kingdom, Russia, and later the United States, and the Central Powers, primarily Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria. The initial stages of the war were characterized by rapid movements and decisive battles, but by late 1914, the conflict settled into a grueling stalemate marked by trench warfare, especially along the Western Front. Soldiers lived in harrowing conditions, enduring mud, disease, and constant bombardment, while combat evolved with the introduction of new technologies such as machine guns, tanks, and poison gas.\n\nOne of the most notable battles of the war was the Battle of Verdun in 1916, which became a symbol of French national determination and resilience. It resulted in massive casualties on both sides, epitomizing the war’s brutal nature and the futility of attrition warfare. The race to break the deadlock introduced bloody offensives, including the Somme, where over a million men were killed or wounded in just a few months of fighting. \n\nThe years of warfare had devastating effects on the civilian population, economies, and political structures of the involved nations. Food shortages, economic hardships, and social unrest—exacerbated by conscription and the loss of a generation of young men—plagued many countries. The war also sparked revolutionary movements, notably in Russia, leading to the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917, which resulted in the withdrawal of Russia from the conflict.\n\nBy 1917, the entry of the United States into the war marked a turning point. Fresh troops and resources bolstered the exhausted Allied forces, contributing significantly to the eventual defeat of the Central Powers. In 1918, a series of offensives known as the Hundred Days Offensive led to a collapse of German forces, culminating in an armistice on November 11, 1918.\n\nThe aftermath of World War I was profoundly transformative. The Treaty of Versailles in 1919 officially ended the conflict, imposing heavy reparations on Germany and redrawing national boundaries, which sowed the seeds for future tensions. The League of Nations was established in an attempt to prevent future conflicts, although it ultimately failed to maintain peace.\n\nIn just four years, World War I resulted in the deaths of approximately 16 million people and irrevocably changed the socio-political landscape of the world. The war’s legacy continues to influence global history, serving as a stark reminder of the consequences of militarism, nationalism, and conflict.",

Today, Mesopotamia is known as present-day Iraq. In the broader sense, the historical region of Mesopotamia also includes parts of present-day Iran, Turkey, Syria and Kuwait. \n\nMesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC. It has been identified as having \"inspired some of the most important developments in human history, including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture\". It is recognised as the cradle of some of the world's earliest civilizations.\n\nThe Sumerians and Akkadians, each originating from different areas, dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of recorded history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC. The rise of empires, beginning with Sargon of Akkad around 2350 BC, characterized the subsequent 2,000 years of Mesopotamian history, marked by the succession of kingdoms and empires such as the Akkadian Empire. The early second millennium BC saw the polarization of Mesopotamian society into Assyria in the north and Babylonia in the south. From 900 to 612 BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire asserted control over much of the ancient Near East. Subsequently, the Babylonians, who had long been overshadowed by Assyria, seized power, dominating the region for a century as the final independent Mesopotamian realm until the modern era. In 539 BC, Mesopotamia was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire under Cyrus the Great. The area was next conquered by Alexander the Great in 332 BC. After his death, it was fought over by the various Diadochi (successors of Alexander), of whom the Seleucids emerged victorious.",
        "ai_text": "Mesopotamia, often referred to as the \"Cradle of Civilization,\" is a historical region located between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq and parts of Syria and Turkey. The name \"Mesopotamia\" comes from the Greek words meaning \"between rivers.\" This area is recognized as one of the birthplaces of human civilization, where some of the earliest complex societies emerged around 3500 BCE.\n\nThe Sumerians, Akkadians, Babylonians, and Assyrians are among the prominent cultures that developed in Mesopotamia. They made significant advancements in various fields, including writing, law, and urban planning. The Sumerians are credited with developing cuneiform, one of the world's first writing systems, used for recording transactions and literature, such as the Epic of Gilgamesh.\n\nMesopotamia's fertile land, nurtured by the annual flooding of the rivers, allowed for the rise of agriculture, which in turn supported population growth and the formation of city-states. Notable cities such as Ur, Babylon, and Nineveh became centers of trade, culture, and governance. The Code of Hammurabi, one of the earliest legal codes, exemplifies the region's sophisticated approach to law and order.\n\nReligion played a central role in Mesopotamian life, with a pantheon of gods and elaborate rituals. The ziggurat, a massive terraced structure, served as both a temple and a symbol of the city's wealth and power.\n\nDespite its eventual decline, largely due to invasions and environmental challenges, Mesopotamia's contributions to human history remain profound. It laid the foundational frameworks for writing, urbanization, and legal systems that continue to influence societies today. Its legacy is evident in modern civilization, showcasing the enduring impact of this ancient region.",

They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. The first walls date to the 7th century BC; these were joined together in the Qin dynasty. Successive dynasties expanded the wall system; the best-known sections were built by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644).\n\nTo aid in defense, the Great Wall utilized watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and its status as a transportation corridor. Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls (allowing control of immigration and emigration, and the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road), and the regulation of trade. \n\nThe collective fortifications constituting the Great Wall stretch from Liaodong in the east to Lop Lake in the west, and from the present-day Sino–Russian border in the north to Tao River in the south: an arc that roughly delineates the edge of the Mongolian steppe, spanning 21,196.18 km (13,170.70 mi) in total.

        "wikipedia_text": "Atlantis (Ancient Greek: Ἀτλαντὶς νῆσος, romanized: Atlantìs nêsos, lit. 'island of Atlas') is a fictional island mentioned in Plato's works Timaeus and Critias as part of an allegory on the hubris of nations. In the story, Atlantis is described as a naval empire that ruled all Western parts of the known world, making it the literary counter-image of the Achaemenid Empire. After an ill-fated attempt to conquer \"Ancient Athens,\" Atlantis falls out of favor with the deities and submerges into the Atlantic Ocean. Since Plato describes Athens as resembling his ideal state in the Republic, the Atlantis story is meant to bear witness to the superiority of his concept of a state.\n\nDespite its minor importance in Plato's work, the Atlantis story has had a considerable impact on literature. The allegorical aspect of Atlantis was taken up in utopian works of several Renaissance writers, such as Francis Bacon's New Atlantis and Thomas More's Utopia. On the other hand, nineteenth-century amateur scholars misinterpreted Plato's narrative as historical tradition, most famously Ignatius L. Donnelly in his Atlantis: The Antediluvian World. Plato's vague indications of the time of the events (more than 9,000 years before his time) and the alleged location of Atlantis (\"beyond the Pillars of Hercules\") gave rise to much pseudoscientific speculation. As a consequence, Atlantis has become a byword for any and all supposed advanced prehistoric lost civilizations and continues to inspire contemporary fiction, from comic books to films.\n\nWhile present-day philologists and classicists agree on the story's fictional nature, there is still debate on what served as its inspiration. Plato is known to have freely borrowed some of his allegories and metaphors from older traditions, as he did with the story of Gyges. This led a number of scholars to suggest possible inspiration of Atlantis from Egyptian records of the Thera eruption, the Sea Peoples invasion, or the Trojan War. Others have rejected this chain of tradition as implausible and insist that Plato created an entirely fictional account, drawing loose inspiration from contemporary events such as the failed Athenian invasion of Sicily in 415–413 BC or the destruction of Helike in 373 BC.",
        "ai_text": "Atlantis, often heralded as one of the most captivating myths of ancient history, is believed to have been a highly advanced civilization that supposedly existed around 11,000 years ago. The tale of Atlantis originates from the dialogues of the philosopher Plato, specifically in \"Timaeus\" and \"Critias,\" written around 360 BCE. According to Plato, Atlantis was a powerful island nation located beyond the \"Pillars of Hercules\" (the modern Strait of Gibraltar) and was larger than Libya and Asia combined.\n\nPlato described Atlantis as a utopian society characterized by magnificent architecture, advanced technology, and a rich culture. Its inhabitants were depicted as noble and highly skilled, enjoying unparalleled prosperity and peace. However, over time, their hubris led them to disregard the gods and stray from virtuous living. As a consequence, the gods unleashed their wrath, culminating in a catastrophic event that caused the island to sink into the ocean in a single day and night of misfortune.\n\nThe story of Atlantis has captured the imaginations of countless scholars, explorers, and dreamers throughout the centuries. While many initially regarded it as merely an allegorical tale, signifying the dangers of pride and moral decay, some modern researchers have sought to uncover potential historical realities behind the legend. Various theories have arisen, suggesting that Atlantis could be linked to actual ancient civilizations such as the Minoans of Crete, the ancient Egyptians, or even the Aztecs, although no conclusive evidence has surfaced to validate these claims.\n\nThe enduring fascination with Atlantis has inspired numerous works of literature, films, and scientific expeditions, creating a cultural phenomenon that transcends time. Its allure lies in the mystery of its existence and the lessons it imparts about human ambition, the interrelationship of civilization and nature, and the potential for greatness and downfall in human societies. Despite the absence of concrete proof, Atlantis remains a symbol of both aspiration and caution, a reminder of the delicate balance between achievement and humility.",

        "wikipedia_text": "An aurora (pl. aurorae or auroras),\n\nalso commonly known as the northern lights (aurora borealis) or southern lights (aurora australis), is a natural light display in Earth's sky, predominantly seen in high-latitude regions (around the Arctic and Antarctic). Auroras display dynamic patterns of brilliant lights that appear as curtains, rays, spirals, or dynamic flickers covering the entire sky.\n\nAuroras are the result of disturbances in the Earth's magnetosphere caused by the solar wind. Major disturbances result from enhancements in the speed of the solar wind from coronal holes and coronal mass ejections. These disturbances alter the trajectories of charged particles in the magnetospheric plasma. These particles, mainly electrons and protons, precipitate into the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). The resulting ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents emit light of varying colour and complexity. The form of the aurora, occurring within bands around both polar regions, is also dependent on the amount of acceleration imparted to the precipitating particles.",
        "ai_text": "Auroras, also known as the northern and southern lights, are stunning natural light displays that occur in polar regions. These phenomena are caused by the interaction between charged particles from the sun and Earth's magnetic field. When solar winds carry electrons and protons toward our planet, they collide with gases in the upper atmosphere, primarily oxygen and nitrogen. This excitation of gas molecules releases energy in the form of light, resulting in vibrant colors that typically manifest as green, pink, red, blue, and violet.\n\nThe auroras are most visible in high-latitude areas around the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, where the Earth's magnetic field is strongest. Aurora Borealis, the northern counterpart, can be seen in places like Canada, Norway, and Alaska, while Aurora Australis graces the southern hemisphere, illuminating skies in regions like Antarctica and parts of Australia. These magical displays not only captivate observers but also hold scientific significance, providing insights into solar activity and Earth's magnetosphere.",

        "wikipedia_text": "The Great Barrier Reef is the world's largest coral reef system, composed of over 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands stretching for over 2,300 kilometres (1,400 mi) over an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometres (133,000 sq mi). The reef is located in the Coral Sea, off the coast of Queensland, Australia, separated from the coast by a channel 160 kilometres (100 mi) wide in places and over 61 metres (200 ft) deep. The Great Barrier Reef can be seen from outer space and is the world's biggest single structure made by living organisms. This reef structure is composed of and built by billions of tiny organisms, known as coral polyps. It supports a wide diversity of life and was selected as a World Heritage Site in 1981. CNN labelled it one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World in 1997. Australian World Heritage places included it in its list in 2007. The Queensland National Trust named it a state icon of Queensland in 2006.\n\nA large part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, which helps to limit the impact of human use, such as fishing and tourism. Other environmental pressures on the reef and its ecosystem include runoff of humanmade pollutants, climate change accompanied by mass coral bleaching, dumping of dredging sludge and cyclic population outbreaks of the crown-of-thorns starfish. According to a study published in October 2012 by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the reef has lost more than half its coral cover since 1985, a finding reaffirmed by a 2020 study which found over half of the reef's coral cover to have been lost between 1995 and 2017, with the effects of a widespread 2020 bleaching event not yet quantified.\n\nThe Great Barrier Reef has long been known to and used by the Aboriginal Australian and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is an important part of local groups' cultures and spirituality. The reef is a very popular destination for tourists, especially in the Whitsunday Islands and Cairns regions. Tourism is an important economic activity for the region, generating over AUD$3 billion per year. In November 2014, Google launched Google Underwater Street View in 3D of the Great Barrier Reef.",
        "ai_text": "The Great Barrier Reef, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is the world’s largest coral reef system, spanning over 2,300 kilometers off the northeastern coast of Australia. This breathtaking natural wonder consists of more than 2,900 individual reefs and 900 islands, encompassing an area of approximately 344,400 square kilometers. Home to an extraordinary diversity of marine life, the reef supports a staggering array of ecosystems, including thousands of species of fish, coral, mollusks, and marine mammals.\n\nOne of the most remarkable features of the Great Barrier Reef is its biodiversity. It is estimated that the reef is home to over 1,500 species of fish, 400 species of coral, and numerous other marine organisms, including sharks, turtles, and seabirds. The coral itself is a vital component of the ecosystem, providing habitat and food for countless marine species. Renowned for its vibrant colors and intricate structures, the coral formations also reflect the overall health of the reef, making coral reefs critical indicators of environmental changes.\n\nTourism plays a significant role in the economy of the surrounding regions, with millions of visitors flocking each year to explore the stunning underwater landscapes through snorkeling and scuba diving. These activities not only offer breathtaking views of the colorful coral gardens and diverse marine wildlife but also create awareness about the importance of conservation. However, this influx of tourists has raised concerns about the ecological impact on the reef, underscoring the need for sustainable practices and protective measures.\n\nDespite its natural beauty, the Great Barrier Reef faces significant threats from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. Rising sea temperatures lead to coral bleaching, a phenomenon where stressed corals expel the algae living in their tissues, resulting in a loss of color and essential nutrients. Additionally, agricultural runoff and plastic pollution threaten the delicate balance of this ecosystem.\n\nConservation efforts are critical to protect the Great Barrier Reef’s health and longevity. Various organizations and governments are working to implement sustainable practices, reduce carbon emissions, and foster responsible tourism. Preserving this iconic marine ecosystem is not only vital for its inhabitants but for the global environment, as it plays a crucial role in carbon regulation and coastal protection.

        "wikipedia_text": "Present-day climate change includes both global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its wider effects on Earth’s climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global temperatures is driven by human activities, especially fossil fuel burning since the Industrial Revolution. Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices release greenhouse gases. These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, the primary gas driving global warming, has increased in concentration by about 50% since the pre-industrial era to levels not seen for millions of years.\n\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment. Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common. Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline. Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes. Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.\n\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result. The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.",
        "ai_text": "Climate change is one of the most pressing challenges facing humanity today. It refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's climate, largely driven by human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes. This has led to an increase in greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide and methane, which trap heat in the atmosphere, resulting in a range of environmental impacts.\n\nThe consequences of climate change are profound and far-reaching. Global temperatures have risen significantly over the past century, with the last decade being the hottest on record. This warming is causing melting ice caps and glaciers, leading to rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities worldwide. Moreover, changing weather patterns are contributing to more frequent and intense natural disasters, including hurricanes, floods, droughts, and wildfires, disrupting ecosystems and endangering species.\n\nBeyond environmental degradation, climate change poses severe risks to human health and socio-economic stability. Vulnerable populations, particularly in developing countries, face food and water scarcity, displacement, and increased health risks due to heatwaves and diseases. The economic repercussions are also significant; industries reliant on natural resources, such as agriculture, fishing, and tourism, are experiencing disruptions that can lead to job losses and increased poverty.\n\nAddressing climate change requires a concerted global effort. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, enhancing energy efficiency, and promoting sustainable land use practices are crucial steps. International agreements, such as the Paris Agreement, aim to unite countries in their efforts to limit global warming and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Individual actions, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and advocating for sustainable policies, are also vital.\n\nIn conclusion, while the challenges of climate change are daunting, they are not insurmountable. With collective action, innovation, and dedication, it is possible to build a more sustainable future for generations to come.",

        "wikipedia_text": "William Shakespeare (c. 23 April 1564 – 23 April 1616) was an English playwright, poet and actor. He is widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet and the \"Bard of Avon\" (or simply \"the Bard\"). His extant works, including collaborations, consist of some 39 plays, 154 sonnets, three long narrative poems and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted.\n\nShakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire. At the age of 18, he married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children: Susanna, and twins Hamnet and Judith. Sometime between 1585 and 1592, he began a successful career in London as an actor, writer, and part-owner (\"sharer\") of a playing company called the Lord Chamberlain's Men, later known as the King's Men after the ascension of King James VI of Scotland to the English throne. At age 49 (around 1613), he appears to have retired to Stratford, where he died three years later. Few records of Shakespeare's private life survive; this has stimulated considerable speculation about such matters as his physical appearance, his sexuality, his religious beliefs and even certain fringe theories as to whether the works attributed to him were written by others.\n\nShakespeare produced most of his known works between 1589 and 1613. His early plays were primarily comedies and histories and are regarded as some of the best works produced in these genres. He then wrote mainly tragedies until 1608, among them Hamlet, Othello, King Lear and Macbeth, all considered to be among the finest works in English. In the last phase of his life, he wrote tragicomedies (also known as romances) such as The Winter's Tale and The Tempest, and collaborated with other playwrights.",

His contributions to literature remain unparalleled, influencing countless writers and artists over the centuries. Shakespeare's life, while shrouded in some mystery, is known to encompass a rich tapestry of creativity and cultural impact.\n\nShakespeare's literary career began in London in the late 16th century, during the era of the English Renaissance, when the arts flourished. His work includes 39 plays, 154 sonnets, and two long narrative poems. His plays can be categorized into three main genres: tragedies, comedies, and histories. Some of his most renowned tragedies include \"Hamlet,\" \"Othello,\" \"Macbeth,\" and \"King Lear,\" which explore profound themes such as the human condition, ambition, love, and betrayal. In contrast, his comedies, such as \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" and \"Twelfth Night,\" showcase his mastery of humor, wordplay, and complex characters.\n\nShakespeare’s keen insight into human nature and his ability to capture the essence of emotions allow his works to resonate deeply with audiences, transcending time and culture. His unique use of the English language also drew attention; he is credited with coining many words and phrases still in use today.\n\nThe Globe Theatre, where many of his plays were performed, became a cultural hub of London and played a significant role in the evolution of theatre. Despite his success, little is known about his personal life. He married Anne Hathaway, with whom he had three children, and his later years were spent in Stratford, where he passed away in April 1616.\n\nShakespeare’s legacy endures through his work, which continues to be studied, performed, and adapted worldwide. His exploration of universal themes, complex characters, and innovative language ensures that his voice remains a vital part of literary and theatrical tradition.",

Considered an archetypal masterpiece of the Italian Renaissance, it has been described as \"the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, [and] the most parodied work of art in the world.\" The painting's novel qualities include the subject's enigmatic expression, monumentality of the composition, the subtle modelling of forms, and the atmospheric illusionism.\n\nThe painting has been traditionally considered to depict the Italian noblewoman Lisa del Giocondo. It is painted in oil on a white poplar panel. Leonardo never gave the painting to the Giocondo family. It was believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506; however, Leonardo may have continued working on it as late as 1517. King Francis I of France acquired the Mona Lisa after Leonardo's death in 1519, and it is now the property of the French Republic. It has normally been on display at the Louvre in Paris since 1797.\n\nThe painting's global fame and popularity partly stem from its 1911 theft by Vincenzo Peruggia, who attributed his actions to Italian patriotism—a belief it should belong to Italy. The theft and subsequent recovery in 1914 generated unprecedented publicity for an art theft, and led to the publication of many cultural depictions such as the 1915 opera Mona Lisa, two early 1930s films (The Theft of the Mona Lisa and Arsène Lupin), and the song \"Mona Lisa\" recorded by Nat King Cole—one of the most successful songs of the 1950s.",

It can explore science and technology in different ways, such as human responses to theoretical new advancements, or the consequences thereof. \n\nScience fiction is related to fantasy, horror, and superhero fiction and contains many subgenres. Its exact definition has long been disputed among authors, critics, scholars, and readers. Subgenres include hard science fiction, which emphasizes scientific accuracy, and soft science fiction, focusing on social sciences. Other notable subgenres are cyberpunk, which explores the interface between technology and society, and climate fiction, addressing environmental issues.\n\nPrecedents for science fiction are argued to exist as far back as antiquity, but the modern genre primarily arose in the 19th and early 20th centuries when popular writers began looking to technological progress and speculation. Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, written in 1818, is often credited as the first true science fiction novel. Jules Verne and H.G. Wells are pivotal figures in the genre's development.

These stories concern the ancient Greek religion's view of the origin and nature of the world; the lives and activities of deities, heroes, and mythological creatures; and the origins and significance of the ancient Greeks' cult and ritual practices. Modern scholars study the myths to shed light on the religious and political institutions of ancient Greece, and to better understand the nature of mythmaking itself.\n\nThe Greek myths were initially propagated in an oral-poetic tradition most likely by Minoan and Mycenaean singers starting in the 18th century BC; eventually the myths of the heroes of the Trojan War and its aftermath became part of the oral tradition of Homer's epic poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Two poems by Homer's near contemporary Hesiod, the Theogony and the Works and Days, contain accounts of the genesis of the world, the succession of divine rulers, the succession of human ages, the origin of human woes, and the origin of sacrificial practices. Myths are also preserved in the Homeric Hymns, in fragments of epic poems of the Epic Cycle, in lyric poems, in the works of the tragedians and comedians of the fifth century BC, in writings of scholars and poets of the Hellenistic Age, and in texts from the time of the Roman Empire by writers such as Plutarch and Pausanias.\n\nAside from this narrative deposit in ancient Greek literature, pictorial representations of gods, heroes, and mythic episodes featured prominently in ancient vase paintings and the decoration of votive gifts and many other artifacts. Geometric designs on pottery of the eighth century BC depict scenes from the Epic Cycle as well as the adventures of Heracles. In the succeeding Archaic, Classical, and Hellenistic periods, Homeric and various other mythological scenes appear, supplementing the existing literary evidence.",
        "ai_text": "Greek mythology is a rich tapestry of stories and legends that has shaped Western culture and influenced countless artistic and literary traditions. At its core, Greek mythology encompasses the ancient Greeks' beliefs about gods, heroes, and the cosmos. The pantheon of Greek deities is led by Zeus, the king of the gods, who rules from Mount Olympus. The gods are characterized by their human-like qualities—immense power, capriciousness, and often, deep flaws. Athena, the goddess of wisdom, and Apollo, the god of music and prophecy, exemplify the range of divine attributes.\n\nThe myths often highlight the heroic exploits of mortal figures such as Heracles, Odysseus, and Perseus, whose adventures typically serve as allegories for human struggles. Heracles, famed for his strength and the Twelve Labors, represents the theme of redemption and the quest for atonement. Odysseus’s prolonged journey home in \"The Odyssey\" encapsulates themes of cunning, perseverance, and the longing for home.\n\nGreek mythology also delves into complex relationships between gods and mortals. The love affairs and rivalries among deities often have dire consequences for humanity. The tale of Persephone, kidnapped by Hades into the Underworld, symbolizes the changing seasons and the cycle of life and death.\n\nBeyond mere stories, these myths provided the ancient Greeks with explanations for natural phenomena and a framework for understanding their world. Festivals, such as the Panathenaea and the Dionysia, celebrated these narratives through drama, poetry, and ritual.\n\nGreek mythology’s enduring legacy is evident today, echoing in literature, art, psychology, and even modern media.

In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His oeuvre includes landscapes, still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art. Van Gogh's work was only beginning to gain critical attention before he died from a self-inflicted gunshot at age 37. During his lifetime, only one of Van Gogh's paintings, The Red Vineyard, was sold. \n\nBorn into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was serious, quiet and thoughtful, but showed signs of mental instability. As a young man, he worked as an art dealer, often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London. He turned to religion and spent time as a missionary in southern Belgium. Later he drifted into ill-health and solitude. He was keenly aware of modernist trends in art and, while back with his parents, took up painting in 1881. His younger brother, Theo, supported him financially, and the two of them maintained a long correspondence.\n\nVan Gogh's early works consist of mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers. In 1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the artistic avant-garde, including Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were seeking new paths beyond Impressionism. Frustrated in Paris and inspired by a growing spirit of artistic change and collaboration, in February 1888 Van Gogh moved to Arles in southern France to establish an artistic retreat and commune. Once there, his paintings grew brighter and he turned his attention to the natural world, depicting local olive groves, wheat fields and sunflowers. Van Gogh invited Gauguin to join him in Arles and eagerly anticipated Gauguin's arrival in late 1888.",
        "ai_text": "Vincent van Gogh, born on March 30, 1853, in the Netherlands, is one of the most celebrated painters of the Post-Impressionist movement. Despite his profound impact on modern art, Van Gogh's life was marked by personal struggles and extreme emotional turmoil. He produced an impressive body of work during his short lifetime, creating over 2,000 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings.\n\nVan Gogh's artistic journey began relatively late; he initially worked as an art dealer and later pursued a career as a painter. His early works, influenced by the Dutch masters, often depicted peasant life and rural landscapes. However, after moving to Paris in 1886, he encountered Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist artists, which profoundly changed his style. Embracing vibrant colors and expressive brushwork, Van Gogh developed a unique technique characterized by swirling forms and emotional intensity.\n\nHis time in Arles, France, marked a prolific period during which he created some of his most famous pieces, such as \"The Starry Night\" and \"The Café Terrace on the Place du Forum.\" These works reflect his fascination with color and light, as well as his desire to convey his emotional state through art. Van Gogh's works often exhibit a sense of movement, drawing viewers into the emotional depth of each scene.\n\nDespite his undeniable talent, Van Gogh struggled with mental illness throughout his life, leading to bouts of depression and anxiety. His most infamous episode occurred in 1888 when he famously cut off a portion of his own ear after a heated argument with fellow artist Paul Gauguin. After living in an asylum in Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, his struggles continued, and he ultimately succumbed to his mental health battles, dying from a gunshot wound in July 1890, believed to be self-inflicted.\n\nToday, Vincent van Gogh is celebrated as a pioneer of modern art. His bold use of color, innovative techniques, and raw emotional expressiveness continue to inspire generations of artists and art lovers worldwide, ensuring his legacy endures long after his tragic life.",

        "wikipedia_text": "A graphic novel is a self-contained, book-length form of sequential art. The term graphic novel is often applied broadly, including fiction, non-fiction, and anthologized work, though this practice is highly contested by comics scholars and industry professionals. It is, at least in the United States, typically distinct from the term comic book, which is generally used for comics periodicals and trade paperbacks.\n\nFan historian Richard Kyle coined the term graphic novel in an essay in the November 1964 issue of the comics fanzine Capa-Alpha. The term gained popularity in the comics community after the publication of Will Eisner's A Contract with God (1978) and the start of the Marvel Graphic Novel line (1982) and became familiar to the public in the late 1980s after the commercial successes of the first volume of Art Spiegelman's Maus in 1986, the collected editions of Frank Miller's The Dark Knight Returns in 1986 and Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' Watchmen in 1987. The Book Industry Study Group began using graphic novel as a category in book stores in 2001.\n\nDefinition",
        "ai_text": "Graphic novels are a unique and compelling form of storytelling that combines visuals and text to create an immersive reading experience. Unlike traditional comic books, graphic novels often feature longer, more complex narratives, allowing for deeper character development and intricate plots. They utilize illustrations, color palettes, and layout designs to enhance the story, engaging readers on both visual and emotional levels.\n\nSpanning various genres—from fantasy and science fiction to memoir and historical fiction—graphic novels appeal to a diverse audience. Renowned works like Art Spiegelman's \"Maus\" and Marjane Satrapi's \"Persepolis\" demonstrate the medium's potential to address profound social issues and personal experiences. The interplay of images and words can convey nuanced emotions and themes that resonate deeply with readers.\n\nWith the rise of digital platforms and self-publishing, graphic novels have gained increased visibility, sparking interest among new generations of creators and fans. As a result, they continue to evolve, reflecting contemporary issues and pushing artistic boundaries. Ultimately, graphic novels stand as a testament to the power of visual storytelling, bridging gaps between art and literature while inviting readers into richly crafted worlds.",

Outside Japan and in English, anime refers specifically to animation produced in Japan. However, anime, in Japan and in Japanese, describes all animated works, regardless of style or origin. Many works of animation with a similar style to Japanese animation are also produced outside Japan. Video games sometimes also feature themes and art styles that are sometimes labelled as anime.\n\nThe earliest commercial Japanese animation dates to 1917. A characteristic art style emerged in the 1960s with the works of cartoonist Osamu Tezuka and spread in the following decades, developing a large domestic audience. Anime is distributed theatrically, through television broadcasts, directly to home media, and over the Internet. In addition to original works, anime are often adaptations of Japanese comics (manga), light novels, or video games. It is classified into numerous genres targeting various broad and niche audiences.\n\nAnime is a diverse medium with distinctive production methods that have adapted in response to emergent technologies. It combines graphic art, characterization, cinematography, and other forms of imaginative and individualistic techniques. Compared to Western animation, anime production generally focuses less on movement, and more on the detail of settings and use of \"camera effects\", such as panning, zooming, and angle shots. Diverse art styles are used, and character proportions and features can be quite varied, with a common characteristic feature being large and emotive eyes.",

        "wikipedia_text": "Surrealism is an art and cultural movement that developed in Europe in the aftermath of World War I in which artists aimed to allow the unconscious mind to express itself, often resulting in the depiction of illogical or dreamlike scenes and ideas. Its intention was, according to leader André Breton, to \"resolve the previously contradictory conditions of dream and reality into an absolute reality, a super-reality\", or surreality. It produced works of painting, writing, theatre, filmmaking, photography, and other media as well.\n\nWorks of Surrealism feature the element of surprise, unexpected juxtapositions and non sequitur. However, many Surrealist artists and writers regard their work as an expression of the philosophical movement first and foremost (for instance, of the \"pure psychic automatism\" Breton speaks of in the first Surrealist Manifesto), with the works themselves being secondary, i.e., artifacts of surrealist experimentation. Leader Breton was explicit in his assertion that Surrealism was, above all, a revolutionary movement. At the time, the movement was associated with political causes such as communism and anarchism. It was influenced by the Dada movement of the 1910s.\n\nThe term \"Surrealism\" originated with Guillaume Apollinaire in 1917. However, the Surrealist movement was not officially established until after October 1924, when the Surrealist Manifesto published by French poet and critic André Breton succeeded in claiming the term for his group over a rival faction led by Yvan Goll, who had published his own surrealist manifesto two weeks prior. The most important center of the movement was Paris, France. From the 1920s onward, the movement spread around the globe, impacting the visual arts, literature, theatre, film, and music of many countries and languages, as well as political thought and practice, philosophy, and social theory.",
        "ai_text": "Surrealism, an influential artistic and literary movement that emerged in the early 20th century, sought to transcend the boundaries of reality and logic by exploring the unconscious mind. Founded in the aftermath of World War I, it was deeply rooted in the desire to disrupt the traditional norms and conventions of art and literature, paving the way for a new form of expression that embraced dreams, imagination, and the absurd.\n\nCentral to Surrealism is the idea of automatism, a technique that encourages artists to create without the constraints of rational thought or premeditation. This approach aimed to tap into the subconscious, revealing hidden desires and thoughts that are often suppressed by everyday consciousness. Pioneers such as André Breton, who authored the Surrealist Manifesto in 1924, emphasized the importance of spontaneity and freedom of expression.\n\nThe visual art produced during this period is characterized by bizarre juxtapositions and dream-like scenes. Artists like Salvador Dalí, René Magritte, and Max Ernst created works that challenge perception, often combining incongruent elements to evoke a sense of wonder or discomfort. Dalí’s melting clocks in “The Persistence of Memory” serve as a profound exploration of time and reality, while Magritte’s enigmatic imagery invites viewers to question the nature of representation.\n\nIn literature, Surrealist writers, including Paul Éluard and Louis Aragon, employed evocative language and non-linear narratives to reflect the illogical nature of dreams. Their works often embrace paradox and bizarre imagery, revealing the complexities of human emotion and thought.\n\nSurrealism's impact extends beyond the confines of art, influencing philosophy, psychology, and even politics. Its legacy persists in contemporary artistic practices, continuing to challenge perceptions of reality and the power of imagination.",

In examining meaning, purpose, and value, existentialist thought often includes concepts such as existential crises, angst, courage, and freedom.\n\nExistentialism is associated with several 19th- and 20th-century European philosophers who shared an emphasis on the human subject, despite often profound differences in thought. Among the 19th-century figures now associated with existentialism are philosophers Søren Kierkegaard and Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky, all of whom critiqued rationalism and concerned themselves with the problem of meaning. The word existentialism, however, was not coined until the mid 20th century, during which it became most associated with contemporaneous philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre, Martin Heidegger, Simone de Beauvoir, Karl Jaspers, Gabriel Marcel, Paul Tillich, and more controversially Albert Camus. \n\nMany existentialists considered traditional systematic or academic philosophies, in style and content, to be too abstract and removed from concrete human experience.

Friedrich Nietzsche challenged traditional moral values, proclaiming the \"death of God\" and advocating for the creation of individual values. Following them, 20th-century philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir deepened existentialist discourse, exploring themes of freedom, responsibility, and the nature of human relationships. Sartre's assertion that \"we are condemned to be free\" highlights the weight of personal choice and the burden of creating one's identity in a world that lacks inherent meaning.\n\nExistentialism's impact extends beyond philosophy, influencing literature, psychology, and the arts.

        "wikipedia_text": "Stoicism is a school of Hellenistic philosophy that flourished in ancient Greece and ancient Rome. The Stoics believed that the practice of virtue is enough to achieve eudaimonia: a well-lived life. The Stoics identified the path to achieving it with a life spent practicing the four cardinal virtues in everyday life — prudence, fortitude, temperance, and justice — as well as living in accordance with nature. It was founded in the ancient Agora of Athens by Zeno of Citium around 300 BCE. \n\nAlongside Aristotle's ethics, the Stoic tradition forms one of the major founding approaches to virtue ethics. The Stoics are especially known for teaching that \"virtue is the only good\" for human beings, and that external things, such as health, wealth, and pleasure, are not good or bad in themselves (adiaphora) but have value as \"material for virtue to act upon\". Many Stoics—such as Seneca and Epictetus—emphasized that because \"virtue is sufficient for happiness\", a sage would be emotionally resilient to misfortune. The Stoics also believed that certain destructive emotions resulted from errors of judgment, and people should aim to maintain a will (called prohairesis) that is \"in accordance with nature\". Because of this, the Stoics thought the best indication of an individual's philosophy was not what a person said but how the person behaved. To live a good life, one had to understand the rules of the natural order since they believed everything was rooted in nature.\n\nStoicism flourished throughout the Roman and Greek world until the 3rd century CE, and among its adherents was Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius. It experienced a decline after Christianity became the state religion in the 4th century CE. Since then, it has seen revivals, notably in the Renaissance (Neostoicism) and in the contemporary era (modern Stoicism).",
        "ai_text": "Stoicism is an ancient Greek philosophical school founded in Athens by Zeno of Citium in the early 3rd century BCE. It emphasizes rationality, self-control, and virtue as essential components of a good life. The core tenet of Stoicism is the belief that while we cannot control external events, we can control our responses to them. This distinction between what is within our control and what is not is fundamental to Stoic thought, guiding individuals toward inner peace and resilience.\n\nStoics advocate for the development of personal virtue, particularly through wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance. They teach that true happiness comes from living in accordance with nature and reason. This means understanding the limitations of human existence and accepting fate with equanimity. Stoic philosophers like Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius provided valuable insights on coping with adversity, emphasizing practices such as negative visualization, where individuals contemplate loss to appreciate what they have more fully.\n\nAnother key aspect of Stoicism is its focus on community and the common good. Stoics believe in the interconnectedness of humanity and advocate for acting with integrity and responsibility towards others. This moral framework promotes a sense of belonging and duty that transcends personal ambition.\n\nIn modern times, Stoicism has experienced a resurgence as people seek practical tools for managing stress and cultivating resilience in a fast-paced world. Its teachings offer valuable strategies for maintaining composure amid challenges, making it relevant in today’s context. By promoting mindfulness, rational thinking, and ethical living, Stoicism encourages individuals to lead meaningful lives, regardless of external circumstances. Embracing Stoicism can foster a profound sense of tranquility and purpose, empowering individuals to navigate life’s complexities with grace and wisdom.",

It is the world's fourth-largest religion, with almost 500 million followers, known as Buddhists, who comprise seven percent of the global population. It arose in the eastern Gangetic plain as a śramaṇa movement in the 5th century BCE, and gradually spread throughout much of Asia. Buddhism has subsequently played a major role in Asian culture and spirituality, eventually spreading to the West in the 20th century.\n\nAccording to tradition, the Buddha instructed his followers in a path of development which leads to awakening and full liberation from dukkha (lit. 'suffering or unease'). He regarded this path as a Middle Way between extremes such as asceticism or sensual indulgence. Teaching that dukkha arises alongside attachment or clinging, the Buddha advised meditation practices and ethical precepts rooted in non-harming. Widely observed teachings include the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and the doctrines of dependent origination, karma, and the three marks of existence. Other commonly observed elements include the Triple Gem, the taking of monastic vows, and the cultivation of perfections (pāramitā).\n\nThe Buddhist canon is vast, with many different textual collections in different languages (such as Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, and Chinese). Buddhist schools vary in their interpretation of the paths to liberation (mārga) as well as the relative importance and \"canonicity\" assigned to various Buddhist texts, and their specific teachings and practices. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravāda (lit. 'School of the Elders') and Mahāyāna (lit. 'Great Vehicle'). The Theravada tradition emphasizes the attainment of nirvāṇa (lit. 'extinguishing') as a means of transcending the individual self and ending the cycle of death and rebirth (saṃsāra), while the Mahayana tradition emphasizes the Bodhisattva ideal, in which one works for the liberation of all sentient beings. Additionally, Vajrayāna (lit. 'Indestructible Vehicle'), a body of teachings incorporating esoteric tantric techniques, may be viewed as a separate branch or tradition within Mahāyāna.",
        "ai_text": "Buddhism is a spiritual and philosophical tradition that originated in the 5th to 4th centuries BCE in ancient India with the teachings of Siddhartha Gautama, known as the Buddha, which means \"the Enlightened One.\" The roots of Buddhism lie in the quest for understanding the nature of suffering and the path to liberation from it. At its core, Buddhism teaches the Four Noble Truths: the truth of suffering (Dukkha), the origin of suffering (Samudaya), the cessation of suffering (Nirodha), and the path leading to the cessation of suffering (Magga). This path is encapsulated in the Eightfold Path, which emphasizes ethical conduct, mental discipline, and wisdom.\n\nBuddhism distinguishes itself with its emphasis on personal experience and mindfulness, rather than adherence to dogma or rituals. One of its key practices is meditation, which cultivates awareness and insights into the nature of existence. Practitioners aim to develop skills such as concentration, mindfulness, and compassion, fostering a deeper understanding of the self and the interconnectedness of all life.\n\nOver centuries, Buddhism has diverged into various schools and traditions, the major ones being Theravada, Mahayana, and Vajrayana. Theravada, often considered the \"Teaching of the Elders,\" is predominantly practiced in Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Myanmar, focusing on individual enlightenment and the historical Buddha's teachings. Mahayana, which encompasses a wide range of practices and beliefs, is prevalent in East Asia, promoting the idea of the Bodhisattva—a being dedicated to achieving enlightenment for the sake of all sentient beings. Vajrayana, or Tibetan Buddhism, incorporates unique rituals and teachings, emphasizing esoteric practices and the guidance of a teacher (lama).\n\nIn modern times, Buddhism has gained global prominence, attracting followers from diverse backgrounds who appreciate its insights into coping with stress, fostering compassion, and encouraging a mindful way of living. As a living tradition, Buddhism continues to evolve, holding relevance in contemporary discussions on mental health, social justice, and environmental awareness. Ultimately, Buddhism encourages a journey toward inner peace and understanding, inviting individuals to explore the depths of their own consciousness and cultivate a compassionate relationship with the world around them.",

Their polytheistic religion is known for having honoured many deities.\n\nThe presence of Greeks on the Italian peninsula from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became fundamental, such as the cultus of Apollo. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), adapting Greek myths and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art, as the Etruscans had. Etruscan religion was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, used by the state to seek the will of the gods. According to legends, most of Rome's religious institutions could be traced to its founders, particularly Numa Pompilius, the Sabine second king of Rome, who negotiated directly with the gods. This archaic religion was the foundation of the mos maiorum, \"the way of the ancestors\" or simply \"tradition\", viewed as central to Roman identity.",

Regular rituals, sacrifices, and festivals were an integral part of public life, performed by priests and priestesses who ensured that the divine favor was maintained. The Vestal Virgins, for instance, played a crucial role in safeguarding the sacred fire and upholding the city's moral and spiritual health.\n\nIn addition to traditional polytheism, the Romans were also influenced by foreign religions, such as those from the East, including the worship of the Egyptian goddess Isis and the Persian god Mithras. This blend of beliefs facilitated a degree of religious pluralism in Rome.\n\nAs the Empire expanded, so too did its religious practices, leading to a vibrant cultural exchange.

There are different theories as to its nature.\n\nFree will is closely linked to the concepts of moral responsibility, praise, culpability, and other judgements which apply only to actions that are freely chosen. It is also connected with the concepts of advice, persuasion, deliberation, and prohibition. Traditionally, only actions that are freely willed are seen as deserving credit or blame. Whether free will exists and the implications of whether it exists or not constitute some of the longest running debates of philosophy. Some conceive of free will as the ability to act beyond the limits of external influences or wishes.\n\nSome conceive free will to be the capacity to make choices undetermined by past events. Determinism suggests that only one course of events is possible, which is inconsistent with a libertarian model of free will. Ancient Greek philosophy identified this issue, which remains a major focus of philosophical debate. The view that posits free will as incompatible with determinism is called incompatibilism and encompasses both metaphysical libertarianism (the claim that determinism is false and thus free will is at least possible) and hard determinism (the claim that determinism is true and thus free will is not possible).

They posit that our decisions, whether mundane or monumental, define our identities and ultimately shape our destinies. Without free will, concepts of accountability for actions and the moral fabric of society could unravel. \n\nHowever, determinists contend that every choice is a result of prior events and conditions, arguing that factors like genetics, upbringing, and social context heavily influence behavior. From this perspective, free will might be seen as an illusion, where the feeling of choice masks a predetermined path shaped by forces beyond our control.\n\nThe implications of free will extend into various disciplines. In psychology, understanding the mechanisms behind choice can inform therapeutic practices. In the legal realm, it raises questions about culpability and punishment. Meanwhile, theological discussions explore the relationship between human freedom and divine omniscience.\n\nUltimately, the question of free will remains unresolved, inviting ongoing exploration.

Founded by Confucius in the Hundred Schools of Thought era (c. 500 BCE), Confucianism integrates philosophy, ethics, and social governance, with a core focus on virtue, social harmony, and familial responsibility. \n\nConfucianism emphasizes virtue through self-cultivation and communal effort. Key virtues include ren (benevolence), yi (righteousness), li (propriety), zhi (wisdom), and xin (sincerity). These values, deeply tied to the notion of tian (heaven), present a worldview where human relationships and social order are manifestations of sacred moral principles. While Confucianism does not emphasize an omnipotent deity, it upholds tian as a transcendent moral order.\n\nConfucius regarded himself as a transmitter of cultural values from the preceding Xia, Shang, and Western Zhou dynasties. Suppressed during the Legalist Qin dynasty (c. 200 BCE), Confucianism flourished under the Han dynasty (c. 130 BCE), displacing the proto-Taoist Huang–Lao tradition to become the dominant ideological framework, while blending with the pragmatic teachings of Legalism. The Tang dynasty (c. 600 CE) witnessed a response to the rising influence of Buddhism and Taoism in the development of Neo-Confucianism, a reformulated philosophical system that became central to the imperial examination system and the scholar-official class of the Song dynasty (c. 1000 CE).",

Another critical tenet is \"Li,\" often translated as ritual or propriety, which refers to the norms governing social behavior, emphasizing respect for traditions and hierarchical roles.\n\nEducation and self-cultivation are also pivotal in Confucian thought, underlining the belief that individuals can improve themselves and, by extension, society. Confucianism has shaped Chinese governance, social structure, and education for centuries, promoting the idea that a well-ordered society relies on moral leadership.\n\nWhile Confucianism faced challenges during the modern era, particularly with the rise of communism in China, its values continue to resonate, influencing not only Chinese culture but also various East Asian societies, underscoring its enduring legacy.",

It became independent from Italy in 1929 with the Lateran Treaty, and is a distinct territory under \"full ownership, exclusive dominion, and sovereign authority and jurisdiction\" of the Holy See, which is itself a sovereign entity under international law, maintaining the city-state's temporal power, governance, diplomatic, and spiritual independence. The Vatican is also a metonym for the pope, the Holy See, and the Roman Curia.\n\nWith an area of 49 hectares (121 acres) and a population of about 882 (as of 2024), it is the smallest sovereign state in the world both by area and by population. It is also among the least populated capitals in the world. As governed by the Holy See, Vatican City State is an ecclesiastical or sacerdotal-monarchical state ruled by the Pope, who is the bishop of Rome and head of the Catholic Church. The highest state functionaries are all Catholic clergy of various origins. After the Avignon Papacy (1309–1377) the popes have mainly resided at the Apostolic Palace within what is now Vatican City, although at times residing instead in the Quirinal Palace in Rome or elsewhere.\n\nThe Holy See dates back to early Christianity and is the principal episcopal see of the Catholic Church, which has approximately 1.329 billion baptised Catholics in the world as of 2018 in the Latin Church and 23 Eastern Catholic Churches. The independent state of Vatican City, on the other hand, came into existence on 11 February 1929 by the Lateran Treaty between the Holy See and Italy, which spoke of it as a new creation, not as a vestige of the much larger Papal States (756–1870), which had previously encompassed much of Central Italy.",

        "wikipedia_text": "The meaning of life pertains to the inherent significance or philosophical meaning of living or existence in general. There is no consensus on a definitive answer, and thinking or discourse on the topic is sought in the English language through questions such as—but not limited to—\"What is the meaning of life?\", \"What is the purpose of existence?\" or \"Why are we here?\". There have been many proposed answers to these questions from many different cultural and ideological backgrounds. The search for life's meaning has produced much philosophical, scientific, theological, and metaphysical speculation throughout history. Different people and cultures believe different things for the answer to this question. Opinions vary on the usefulness of using time and resources in the pursuit of an answer. Excessive pondering can be indicative of, or lead to, an existential crisis.\n\nThe meaning of life can be derived from philosophical and religious contemplation of, and scientific inquiries about, existence, social ties, consciousness, and happiness. Many other issues are also involved, such as symbolic meaning, ontology, value, purpose, ethics, good and evil, free will, the existence of one or multiple gods, conceptions of God, the soul, and the afterlife. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related empirical facts about the universe, exploring the context and parameters concerning the \"how\" of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the pursuit of well-being and a related conception of morality. An alternative, humanistic approach poses the question, \"What is the meaning of my life?\"\n\nOrigin of the expression",
        "ai_text": "The meaning of life is a profound question that has captivated humanity for millennia. It is a topic that transcends cultures, philosophies, and religions, inviting individuals to reflect on their existence and purpose. Many people find meaning through their connections with others, such as family, friends, and communities. These relationships can offer a sense of belonging and joy, suggesting that love and companionship are central to a fulfilling life.\n\nFor some, meaning is derived from the pursuit of knowledge and self-improvement. Engaging in lifelong learning and exploring new ideas can provide a sense of purpose, driving individuals to better themselves and, in turn, contribute positively to society. Others may find significance in creativity and self-expression, using art, music, or writing to convey their experiences and emotions, thereby making their mark on the world.\n\nSpirituality and religion often offer frameworks for understanding life’s purpose, providing comfort and guidance through beliefs about the afterlife or the interconnectedness of all beings. Additionally, the search for meaning can also be shaped by personal values, whether that may be a commitment to social justice, environmental stewardship, or a dedication to advancing knowledge.\n\nUltimately, the meaning of life is deeply personal and can evolve over time. Each individual's journey is unique, influenced by their experiences, aspirations, and reflections. Embracing this complexity can lead to a richer understanding of one’s purpose, fostering a life that is not just lived, but intentionally shaped.",

        "wikipedia_text": "Atheism, in the broadest sense, is an absence of belief in the existence of deities. Less broadly, atheism is a rejection of the belief that any deities exist. In an even narrower sense, atheism is specifically the position that there are no deities. Atheism is contrasted with theism, which is the belief that at least one deity exists.\n\nHistorically, evidence of atheistic viewpoints can be traced back to classical antiquity and early Indian philosophy. In the Western world, atheism declined after Christianity gained prominence. The 16th century and the Age of Enlightenment marked the resurgence of atheistic thought in Europe. Atheism achieved a significant position worldwide in the 20th century. Estimates of those who have an absence of belief in a god range from 500 million to 1.1 billion people. Atheist organizations have defended the autonomy of science, freedom of thought, secular ethics and secularism.\n\nArguments for atheism range from philosophical to social approaches. Rationales for not believing in deities include the lack of evidence, the problem of evil, the argument from inconsistent revelations, the rejection of concepts that cannot be falsified, and the argument from nonbelief. Nonbelievers contend that atheism is a more parsimonious position than theism and that everyone is born without beliefs in deities; therefore, they argue that the burden of proof lies not on the atheist to disprove the existence of gods but on the theist to provide a rationale for theism.",
        "ai_text": "Atheism, the lack of belief in deities or gods, is a worldview that challenges traditional religious narratives. It is often grounded in skepticism and a reliance on reason, evidence, and scientific inquiry. Atheists typically argue that religious claims lack empirical support and that human understanding of the universe can be explained through naturalistic and logical principles without recourse to supernatural explanations.\n\nHistorically, atheism has been regarded with suspicion and hostility in many societies, often leading to social ostracism and persecution. Despite this, atheism has gained prominence as educational levels and scientific literacy have increased. Prominent figures in philosophy, science, and literature have contributed to atheistic discourse, including thinkers like Friedrich Nietzsche, Karl Marx, and Richard Dawkins, who promote critical examination of religious beliefs.\n\nAtheism encompasses a varied spectrum of perspectives, ranging from soft atheism, which simply lacks belief in gods, to hard atheism, which asserts that gods do not exist. Some atheists identify as secular humanists, emphasizing morality and ethics without religion, while others may align with agnostic viewpoints, suggesting uncertainty about the existence of deities.\n\nIn contemporary society, atheism has sparked important conversations about morality, purpose, and the nature of existence, encouraging debates that challenge the assumptions of religious thought. This evolution reflects a broader move towards secularization, inviting individuals to explore values, ethics, and meaning through a non-theistic lens.",

        "wikipedia_text": "The discovery of penicillin was  one of the most important scientific discoveries in the history of medicine. Ancient societies used moulds to treat infections and in the following centuries many people observed the inhibition of bacterial growth by moulds. While working at St Mary's Hospital in London in 1928, Scottish physician Alexander Fleming was the first to experimentally demonstrate that a Penicillium mould secretes an antibacterial substance, which he named \"penicillin\". The mould was found to be a variant of Penicillium notatum (now called Penicillium rubens), a contaminant of a bacterial culture in his laboratory. The work on penicillin at St Mary's ended in 1929.\n\nIn 1939, a team of scientists at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology at the University of Oxford, led by Howard Florey that included Edward Abraham, Ernst Chain, Norman Heatley and Margaret Jennings, began researching penicillin. They devised a method for cultivating the mould, as well as extracting, purifying and storing penicillin from it.  They created an assay for measuring its purity. They carried out experiments with animals to determine penicillin's safety and effectiveness before conducting clinical trials and field tests. They derived its chemical formula and determined how it works. The private sector and the United States Department of Agriculture located and produced new strains and developed mass production techniques. Penicillin became an important part of the Allied war effort in the Second World War, saving the lives of thousands of soldiers. Fleming, Florey and Chain shared the 1945 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for its discovery and development.\n\nBackground",
        "ai_text": "The discovery of penicillin, one of the most significant breakthroughs in medical history, began serendipitously in 1928 by Scottish bacteriologist Alexander Fleming. While conducting experiments at St. Mary's Hospital in London, Fleming noticed something unusual in one of his Petri dishes, which he had accidentally left uncovered. Mold had contaminated the culture, but he observed that the bacteria surrounding the mold were being destroyed. This mold was identified as *Penicillium notatum*. \n\nIntrigued by this observation, Fleming conducted further experiments and discovered that the mold released a substance capable of killing a wide range of bacteria. He named this substance penicillin. Despite its extraordinary potential, Fleming struggled to produce penicillin in sufficient quantities for clinical use. It wasn’t until the late 1930s and early 1940s, during World War II, that penicillin was mass-produced, thanks to the efforts of scientists like Howard Florey and Ernst Boris Chain, who developed the extraction and production methods.\n\nThe impact of penicillin was monumental. It became the first true antibiotic and revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections, saving countless lives during and after the war. Its success prompted the exploration and development of other antibiotics, establishing a new era in medicine and medical research. Today, penicillin remains a cornerstone of antimicrobial therapy, exemplifying the profound effects of scientific curiosity and the importance of chance in scientific discovery. Fleming’s unintentional finding has had lasting ramifications, transforming healthcare and shaping the course of medicine for generations to come.",

The safety and effectiveness of vaccines has been widely studied and verified. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins, or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize further and destroy any of the microorganisms associated with that agent that it may encounter in the future.\n\nVaccines can be prophylactic (to prevent or alleviate the effects of a future infection by a natural or \"wild\" pathogen), or therapeutic (to fight a disease that has already occurred, such as cancer). Some vaccines offer full sterilizing immunity, in which infection is prevented.\n\nThe administration of vaccines is called vaccination. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are available for twenty-five different preventable infections.",

Types of human microbiota include bacteria, archaea, fungi, protists, and viruses. Though micro-animals can also live on the human body, they are typically excluded from this definition. In the context of genomics, the term human microbiome is sometimes used to refer to the collective genomes of resident microorganisms; however, the term human metagenome has the same meaning.\n\nThe human body hosts many microorganisms, with approximately the same order of magnitude of non-human cells as human cells. Some microorganisms that humans host are commensal, meaning they co-exist without harming humans; others have a mutualistic relationship with their human hosts.: 700  Conversely, some non-pathogenic microorganisms can harm human hosts via the metabolites they produce, like trimethylamine, which the human body converts to trimethylamine N-oxide via FMO3-mediated oxidation. Certain microorganisms perform tasks that are known to be useful to the human host, but the role of most of them is not well understood. Those that are expected to be present, and that under normal circumstances do not cause disease, are sometimes deemed normal flora or normal microbiota.\n\nDuring early life, the establishment of a diverse and balanced human microbiota plays a critical role in shaping an individual's long-term health. Studies have shown that the composition of the gut microbiota during infancy is influenced by various factors, including mode of delivery, breastfeeding, and exposure to environmental factors. There are several beneficial species of bacteria and potential probiotics present in breast milk. Research has highlighted the beneficial effects of a healthy microbiota in early life, such as the promotion of immune system development, regulation of metabolism, and protection against pathogenic microorganisms. Understanding the complex interplay between the human microbiota and early life health is crucial for developing interventions and strategies to support optimal microbiota development and improve overall health outcomes in individuals.",
        "ai_text": "The human microbiome refers to the diverse community of microorganisms, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and archaea, that inhabit various parts of the human body. These microbial inhabitants, particularly those residing in the gut, play a crucial role in maintaining health and influencing disease states. The microbiome is unique to each individual and shaped by factors such as genetics, diet, environment, and lifestyle.\n\nOne of the most significant functions of the microbiome is its role in digestion. Microbes help break down complex carbohydrates, synthesize vitamins, and extract energy from food, assisting in overall nutrient absorption. The gut microbiota also plays an essential role in immune function by training the immune system to distinguish between harmful pathogens and benign substances. This interaction helps to prevent autoimmune diseases and allergies.\n\nRecent research has highlighted the microbiome's involvement in various health conditions. Dysbiosis, an imbalance in the microbiome, has been linked to obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, and even mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. The gut-brain axis, a complex communication network between the gut and brain, illustrates how gut microbiota can influence mood and cognitive functions through the production of neurotransmitters and other metabolites.\n\nAntibiotics, diet, and lifestyle changes can significantly alter the composition of the microbiome. For instance, a diet high in fiber promotes a diverse microbiota rich in beneficial bacteria, while a diet high in processed foods can lead to dysbiosis. Probiotics and prebiotics have garnered attention for their potential to restore microbial balance and promote health.\n\nThe exploration of the human microbiome is still in its early stages, but its implications for personalized medicine are profound. Understanding an individual’s microbiome could lead to tailored interventions, such as dietary modifications or targeted probiotic therapy, promoting optimal health and preventing disease. As research continues, the human microbiome's role in health and disease is sure to reshape our approach to medicine and wellness.",

During sleep, there is a marked decrease in muscle activity and interactions with the surrounding environment. While sleep differs from wakefulness in terms of the ability to react to stimuli, it still involves active brain patterns, making it more reactive than a coma or disorders of consciousness.\n\nSleep occurs in repeating periods, during which the body alternates between two distinct modes: rapid eye movement sleep (REM) and non-REM sleep. Although REM stands for \"rapid eye movement\", this mode of sleep has many other aspects, including virtual paralysis of the body. Dreams are a succession of images, ideas, emotions, and sensations that usually occur involuntarily in the mind during certain stages of sleep.\n\nDuring sleep, most of the body's systems are in an anabolic state, helping to restore the immune, nervous, skeletal, and muscular systems; these are vital processes that maintain mood, memory, and cognitive function, and play a large role in the function of the endocrine and immune systems. The internal circadian clock promotes sleep daily at night, when it is dark. The diverse purposes and mechanisms of sleep are the subject of substantial ongoing research. Sleep is a highly conserved behavior across animal evolution, likely going back hundreds of millions of years, and originating as a means for the brain to cleanse itself of waste products.  In a major breakthrough, researchers have found that cleansing, including the removal of amyloid, may be a core purpose of sleep.",

During sleep, the body undergoes various restorative processes, including muscle repair, immune system strengthening, and memory consolidation.\n\nThe stages of sleep can be divided into Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Each stage plays distinct roles in health. Non-REM sleep is crucial for physical restoration, while REM sleep, which occurs after about 90 minutes of falling asleep, is associated with dreaming and is essential for cognitive functions like learning and emotional regulation.\n\nPoor sleep quality can lead to a myriad of issues, ranging from decreased productivity and cognitive impairments to increased risk of chronic conditions such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Additionally, sleep disorders like insomnia and sleep apnea can severely impact overall health and quality of life.\n\nTo promote better sleep, it’s important to establish a consistent sleep schedule, create a comfortable sleep environment, and limit exposure to screens before bedtime. Techniques such as mindfulness and relaxation exercises can also greatly enhance sleep quality.\n\nIn conclusion, prioritizing sleep is not merely a matter of enjoyment; it is a fundamental aspect of a healthy lifestyle that facilitates physical health, emotional balance, and optimal cognitive function.

When stressed by stimuli that alter an organism's environment, multiple systems respond across the body. In humans and most mammals, the autonomic nervous system and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are the two major systems that respond to stress. Two well-known hormones that humans produce during stressful situations are adrenaline and cortisol.\n\nThe sympathoadrenal medullary axis (SAM) may activate the fight-or-flight response through the sympathetic nervous system, which dedicates energy to more relevant bodily systems to acute adaptation to stress, while the parasympathetic nervous system returns the body to homeostasis.\n\nThe second major physiological stress-response center, the HPA axis, regulates the release of cortisol, which influences many bodily functions, such as metabolic, psychological and immunological functions. The SAM and HPA axes are regulated by several brain regions, including the limbic system, prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hypothalamus, and stria terminalis. Through these mechanisms, stress can alter memory functions, reward, immune function, metabolism, and susceptibility to diseases.",
        "ai_text": "Stress in biology refers to the physiological responses of organisms to perceived threats or challenges in their environment. When an individual encounters stressors—such as physical injury, emotional trauma, or environmental changes—the body activates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

The colon contains the highest microbial density of any human-associated microbial community studied so far, representing between 300 and 1000 different species. Bacteria are the largest and to date, best studied component and 99% of gut bacteria come from about 30 or 40 species. About 55% of the dry mass of feces is bacteria. Over 99% of the bacteria in the gut are anaerobes, but in the cecum, aerobic bacteria reach high densities. It is estimated that the human gut microbiota have around a hundred times as many genes as there are in the human genome.\n\nOverview",
        "ai_text": "Gut microbiota refers to the complex community of microorganisms residing in the gastrointestinal tract, primarily bacteria, along with fungi, viruses, and archaea. These microbial populations play a crucial role in many aspects of human health, influencing digestion, metabolism, and the immune system. A balanced gut microbiota contributes to efficient nutrient absorption and protects against harmful pathogens by competing for resources and producing antimicrobial substances.\n\nRecent research highlights the link between gut microbiota and various health conditions, including obesity, diabetes, inflammatory bowel diseases, and even mental health disorders like anxiety and depression. The diversity and composition of these microbial communities can be influenced by factors such as diet, lifestyle, age, and environment.\n\nDietary choices, particularly the intake of fiber-rich foods, probiotics, and prebiotics, can support a healthy gut microbiota. Conversely, diets high in processed foods and sugars can lead to dysbiosis, an imbalance in gut microbial populations. As science continues to explore the intricate relationship between gut microbiota and overall well-being, the potential for targeted therapies, including personalized nutrition and probiotics, offers exciting possibilities for enhancing health and preventing disease.",

        "title": "Black Death",
        "wikipedia_text": "The Black Death was a bubonic plague pandemic that occurred in Europe from 1346 to 1353. It was one of the most fatal pandemics in human history; as many as 50 million people perished, perhaps 50% of Europe's 14th century population.  The disease is caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and spread by fleas and through the air. One of the most significant events in European history, the Black Death had far-reaching population, economic, and cultural impacts. It was the beginning of the second plague pandemic. The plague created religious, social and economic upheavals, with profound effects on the course of European history.\n\nThe origin of the Black Death is disputed. Genetic analysis suggests Yersinia pestis bacteria evolved approximately 7,000 years ago, at the beginning of the Neolithic, with flea-mediated strains emerging around 3,800 years ago during the late Bronze Age. The immediate territorial origins of the Black Death and its outbreak remain unclear, with some evidence pointing towards Central Asia, China, the Middle East, and Europe. The pandemic was reportedly first introduced to Europe during the siege of the Genoese trading port of Kaffa in Crimea by the Golden Horde army of Jani Beg in 1347. From Crimea, it was most likely carried by fleas living on the black rats that travelled on Genoese ships, spreading through the Mediterranean Basin and reaching North Africa, West Asia, and the rest of Europe via Constantinople, Sicily, and the Italian Peninsula. There is evidence that once it came ashore, the Black Death mainly spread from person-to-person as pneumonic plague, thus explaining the quick inland spread of the epidemic, which was faster than would be expected if the primary vector was rat fleas causing bubonic plague. In 2022, it was discovered that there was a sudden surge of deaths in what is today Kyrgyzstan from the Black Death in the late 1330s; when combined with genetic evidence, this implies that the initial spread may have been unrelated to the 14th century Mongol conquests previously postulated as the cause.\n\nThe Black Death was the second great natural disaster to strike Europe during the Late Middle Ages (the first one being the Great Famine of 1315–1317) and is estimated to have killed 30% to 60% of the European population, as well as approximately 33% of the population of the Middle East. There were further outbreaks throughout the Late Middle Ages and, also due to other contributing factors (the crisis of the late Middle Ages), the European population did not regain its 14th century level until the 16th century. Outbreaks of the plague recurred around the world until the early 19th century.",
        "ai_text": "The Black Death, one of the most devastating pandemics in human history, swept across Europe in the mid-14th century, causing unimaginable loss of life and altering the social structure of the continent. Originating in Asia, the plague made its way to Europe through trade routes, particularly the Silk Road, arriving in the Byzantine Empire in 1347 and subsequently spreading rapidly throughout the continent.\n\nThe causative agent of the Black Death is the bacterium *Yersinia pestis*, which is transmitted through flea bites and can infect both humans and animals. In its bubonic form, the disease is characterized by painful swellings known as buboes, fever, chills, weakness, and headache. When left untreated, the infection can lead to septicemic or pneumonic forms, which are more lethal. The initial outbreak in Europe manifested as a series of bubonic plague epidemics that claimed roughly one-third to one-half of Europe’s population within just a few years.\n\nThe arrival of the Black Death had immediate and far-reaching societal consequences. As the death toll mounted, fear and paranoia permeated communities. With many abandoning their loved ones and fleeing affected areas, entire towns were left deserted. Some individuals and communities sought to make sense of the tragedy, attributing the plague to divine punishment for sins or using it as an opportunity to persecute marginalized groups, particularly Jews, who were scapegoated due to anti-Semitic sentiments.\n\nEconomically, the sudden decrease in population resulted in a labor shortage, contributing to significant shifts in social structures. Landowners, knowing that labor was scarce, raised wages to attract workers, granting the lower classes a degree of economic power they had not experienced before. This shift signified the beginning of the end for the feudal system, as serfs could negotiate better terms and move towards urban centers, seeking opportunities in the burgeoning markets.\n\nCulturally, the Black Death inspired a pervasive memento mori (reminder of death) in art and literature, leading to shifts in perspectives on life, death, and spirituality. The massive loss of life prompted a reflection on the human condition, fostering a heightened interest in morality, the afterlife, and religious devotion alongside skepticism towards established authorities.\n\nThe Black Death did not just ravage the population; it transformed European society in profound ways. The changes initiated during this dark period played a significant role in paving the way for the modern world, leading to advances in medicine, shifts in economic structures, and evolving social norms. The legacy of the Black Death is a stark reminder of the fragility of human life and the resilience of societies in the face of catastrophe.",

        "title": "Olympic Games",
        "wikipedia_text": "The modern Olympic Games (Olympics; French: Jeux olympiques) are the world's leading international sporting events. They feature summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition, with more than 200 teams, representing sovereign states and territories, participating. By default, the Games generally substitute for any world championships during the year in which they take place (however, each class usually maintains its own records). The Olympics are staged every four years. Since 1994, they have alternated between the Summer and Winter Olympics every two years during the four-year Olympiad.\n\nTheir creation was inspired by the ancient Olympic Games, held in Olympia, Greece, from the 8th century BC to the 4th century AD. Baron Pierre de Coubertin founded the International Olympic Committee (IOC) in 1894, leading to the first modern Games in Athens in 1896. The IOC is the governing body of the Olympic Movement, which encompasses all entities and individuals involved in the Olympic Games. The Olympic Charter defines their structure and authority.\n\nThe evolution of the Olympic Movement during the 20th and 21st centuries has resulted in numerous changes to the Olympic Games. Some of these adjustments include the creation of the Winter Olympic Games for snow and ice sports, the Paralympic Games for athletes with disabilities, the Youth Olympic Games for athletes aged 14 to 18, the five Continental Games (Pan American, African, Asian, European, and Pacific), and the World Games for sports that are not contested in the Olympic Games. The IOC also endorses the Deaflympics and the Special Olympics. The IOC has adapted to a variety of economic, political, and technological advancements. The abuse of amateur rules prompted the IOC to shift away from pure amateurism, as envisioned by Coubertin, to the acceptance of professional athletes participating at the Games. The growing importance of mass media has created the issue of corporate sponsorship and general commercialisation of the Games. World Wars I and II led to the cancellation of the 1916, 1940, and 1944 Olympics; large-scale boycotts during the Cold War limited participation in the 1980 and 1984 Olympics; and the 2020 Olympics were postponed until 2021 because of the COVID-19 restrictions.",
        "ai_text": "The Olympic Games, a grand spectacle of athleticism and cultural exchange, trace their origins back to ancient Greece in 776 BC. Initially held in Olympia, these games were dedicated to the god Zeus and served as a unifying event for the myriad of Greek city-states. The ancient Olympics saw athletes competing in events like running, wrestling, and chariot racing, all under the auspices of the Olympic truce, which ensured safe passage for competitors and spectators alike.\n\nThe modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 by Pierre de Coubertin, inspired by the ideals of peace, camaraderie, and excellence that the original events represented. The inaugural modern Olympics took place in Athens, featuring 13 countries and 43 events. Since then, the Games have evolved into a global phenomenon, embodying not just sporting competition but also a celebration of international unity, diversity, and cultural pride.\n\nHeld every four years, the Olympics alternate between the Summer and Winter Games, attracting thousands of athletes from over 200 nations who compete in a vast array of sports—ranging from athletics and swimming to gymnastics and skiing. The Games are a platform for records to be shattered, allowing athletes to showcase their talent and dedication to millions around the world. The Olympic motto, \"Citius, Altius, Fortius,\" or \"Faster, Higher, Stronger,\" encapsulates the relentless pursuit of excellence and the spirit of competition.\n\nBeyond mere athletics, the Olympics serve as a stage for cultural exchange, highlighting the rich traditions of various nations. The opening and closing ceremonies are spectacular showcases of art, music, and performance that pay homage to the host country’s heritage while promoting shared values of unity and peace. The Olympic flame, which burns throughout the Games, symbolizes continuity, honoring the connection between the past and present.\n\nIn recent years, the Olympics have faced challenges, including political tensions, concerns over athlete welfare, and the impact of global issues like the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, the spirit of the Olympics endures, inspiring generations to strive for top athletic performance while fostering a sense of global community. As nations come together, the Olympic Games continue to exemplify the best of humanity’s aspirations—hope, resilience, and mutual respect.",

        "title": "Chess",
        "wikipedia_text": "Chess is an abstract strategy board game for two players which involves no hidden information and no elements of chance. It is played on a square game board called a chessboard containing 64 squares arranged in an 8×8 grid. The players, referred to as \"White\" and \"Black\", each control sixteen pieces: one king, one queen, two rooks, two bishops, two knights, and eight pawns; each type of piece has a different pattern of movement. An enemy piece may be \"captured\" (removed from the board) by moving one's own piece onto the square it occupies; the object of the game is to \"checkmate\" (threaten with inescapable capture) the enemy king. There are also several ways a game can end in a draw.\n\nThe recorded history of chess goes back at least to the emergence of chaturanga—also thought to be an ancestor to similar games like xiangqi and shogi—in seventh-century India. After its introduction in Persia, it spread to the Arab world and then to Europe. The modern rules of chess emerged in Europe at the end of the 15th century, with standardization and universal acceptance by the end of the 19th century. Today, chess is one of the world's most popular games, with millions of players worldwide. \n\nOrganized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE (Fédération Internationale des Échecs; the International Chess Federation). The first universally recognized World Chess Champion, Wilhelm Steinitz, claimed his title in 1886; Gukesh Dommaraju is the current World Champion, having won the title in 2024.",
        "ai_text": "Chess is a centuries-old strategy game that has captivated minds around the world.

The game symbolizes a battle of wits between two players, each commanding an army of 16 pieces: a king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. The objective is simple yet profound: checkmate the opposing king.\n\nThe beauty of chess lies in its complexity. With a virtually infinite number of possible moves and strategies, no two games are ever alike. Players must think several steps ahead, anticipating their opponent’s strategy while formulating their own. This intellectual duel requires not only tactical skill but also strategic foresight, creativity, and psychological acumen.\n\nChess has transcended mere pastime to become a powerful tool for education and cognitive development. It enhances critical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and patience. Schools around the globe have integrated chess into their curricula to promote these skills among students. Additionally, it serves as a cultural bridge, connecting people across different backgrounds and ages through tournaments, clubs, and online platforms.\n\nThe rise of digital technology has further popularized chess, making it accessible to millions. Online platforms like Chess.com and Lichess have transformed the way people learn, play, and compete. Global events, such as the Chess World Championship, draw significant audiences and showcase the game’s enduring appeal.\n\nIn a world where strategy and foresight are invaluable, chess remains a timeless testament to the power of the human mind.",

One definition of sport sees it as \"any physical activity for the purposes of competition, recreation, education or health\".\n\nSport psychology is recognized as an interdisciplinary science that draws on knowledge from many related fields including biomechanics, physiology, kinesiology and psychology. It involves the study of how psychological factors affect performance and how participation in sport and exercise affects psychological, social, and physical factors. Sport psychologists may teach cognitive and behavioral strategies to athletes in order to improve their experience and performance in sports.\n\nA sport psychologist does not focus solely on athletes. This type of professional also helps non-athletes and everyday exercisers learn how to enjoy sports and to stick to an exercise program. A psychologist is someone that helps with the mental and emotional aspects of someone's state, so a sport psychologist would help people in regard to sports, but also in regard to physical activity.

Naismith was a 31-year-old graduate student when he created the indoor sport to keep athletes indoors during the winters. The game became established fairly quickly and grew very popular as the 20th century progressed, first in America and then in other parts of the world. After basketball became established in American colleges, the professional game followed. The American National Basketball Association (NBA), established in 1946, grew to a multibillion-dollar enterprise by the end of the century, and basketball became an integral part of American culture.\n\nEarly history\n\nInvention of the game",

        "wikipedia_text": "Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock-n-roll, and rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. It originated from African American music such as jazz, rhythm and blues, boogie-woogie, electric blues, gospel, and jump blues, as well as country music. While rock and roll's formative elements can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.\n\nAccording to the journalist Greg Kot, \"rock and roll\" refers to a style of popular music originating in the United States in the 1950s. By the mid-1960s, rock and roll had developed into \"the more encompassing international style known as rock music, though the latter also continued to be known in many circles as rock and roll\". For the purpose of differentiation, this article deals with the first definition.\n\nIn the earliest rock and roll styles, either the piano or saxophone was typically the lead instrument. These instruments were generally replaced or supplemented by the electric guitar in the mid-to-late 1950s. The beat is essentially a dance rhythm with an accentuated backbeat, almost always provided by a snare drum. Classic rock and roll is usually played with one or more electric guitars (one lead, one rhythm) and a double bass (string bass). After the mid-1950s, electric bass guitars (\"Fender bass\") and drum kits became popular in classic rock.",
        "ai_text": "Rock and roll emerged in the United States in the late 1940s and early 1950s, blending elements of rhythm and blues, country, jazz, and gospel. Its infectious rhythm and electrifying energy captured the spirit of a generation, ultimately becoming a cultural phenomenon that reshaped music and society. Pioneering artists like Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Elvis Presley played crucial roles in popularizing the genre. Berry's guitar riffs and lyrical storytelling transformed rock and roll into a vehicle for youth expression, while Presley's charismatic performances and unique style brought it into the mainstream.\n\nThe 1960s saw the genre evolve and diversify, with bands like The Beatles and The Rolling Stones pushing musical boundaries. The British Invasion introduced a new wave of rock, characterized by innovative songwriting and experimentation. This era also birthed sub-genres, including punk rock, hard rock, and psychedelic rock, reflecting the evolving cultural landscape.\n\nRock and roll's rebellious spirit resonated with the counterculture movements of the 1960s and 1970s, becoming anthems for social change. Festivals like Woodstock symbolized its power as a unifying force, while legends like Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin left indelible marks on the genre.\n\nDespite its evolution, rock and roll remains a vital influence on contemporary music, inspiring countless artists across genres. Its legacy endures in the hearts of enthusiasts worldwide, serving as a testament to its revolutionary impact on art, culture, and identity. Rock and roll is not just music; it is a cultural revolution that continues to resonate.",

        "title": "Hip hop music",
        "wikipedia_text": "Hip-hop or hip hop (formerly known as disco rap) is a genre of popular music that emerged in the early 1970s in New York City. The genre is characterized by stylized rhythmic sounds—often built around funk grooves, electronic drum beats, and rapping, a percussive vocal delivery of rhymed poetic speech as consciousness-raising expression. The music developed as part of the broader hip-hop culture; while often used to refer solely to rapping and rap music, \"hip-hop\" more properly denotes the practice(s) of the entire subculture. The term hip-hop music is sometimes used synonymously with the term rap music, though rapping may not be the focus of hip-hop music. The genre also centers DJing, turntablism, scratching, beatboxing, and instrumental tracks.\n\nHip-hop as both a musical genre and a culture was formed during the 1970s, when block parties became increasingly popular in New York City, particularly among ethnic minority youth residing in the Bronx. At block parties, DJs played percussive breaks of popular songs using two turntables and a DJ mixer to be able to play breaks from two copies of the same record, alternating from one to the other and extending the \"break\". Hip-hop's early evolution occurred as sampling technology and drum machines became widely available and affordable. Turntablist techniques such as scratching and beatmatching developed along with the breaks. Rapping developed as a vocal style in which the artist speaks or chants along rhythmically with an instrumental or synthesized beat.\n\nHip-hop music was not officially recorded to play on radio or television until 1979, largely due to poverty during the genre's birth and lack of acceptance outside ghetto neighborhoods. The genre of music began spreading through block parties throughout the Black community. Old-school hip hop was the first mainstream wave of the genre, marked by its disco influence and party-oriented lyrics. The 1980s marked the diversification of hip-hop as the genre developed more complex styles and spread around the world. New-school hip hop was the genre's second wave, marked by its electro sound, and led into golden age hip hop, an innovative period between the mid-1980s and mid-1990s that also developed hip-hop's own album era. The gangsta rap subgenre, focused on the violent lifestyles and impoverished conditions of inner-city African American youth, gained popularity at this time. West Coast hip hop was dominated by G-funk in the early-mid 1990s, while East Coast hip hop was dominated by jazz rap, alternative hip hop, and hardcore hip hop. Hip-hop continued to diversify at this time with other regional styles emerging, such as Southern rap and Atlanta hip hop. Hip-hop became a best-selling genre in the mid-1990s and the top-selling music genre by 1999. Hip-hop became a category at the Grammy Awards in 1989 with the addition of the Best Rap Performance award and was given to DJ Jazzy Jeff & the Fresh Prince for their song \"Parents Just Don't Understand\". In 1990, they became the first hip-hop act to perform at the Grammys.",
        "ai_text": "Hip hop music, a dynamic force since its inception in the 1970s, has evolved into one of the most influential genres worldwide. Originating in the South Bronx, New York City, hip hop was born as a cultural movement that encompassed not only music but also dance, art, and fashion. Artists began to blend rhythm and poetry, giving voice to their experiences and struggles, shaping a sonic landscape deeply rooted in the realities of urban life.\n\nAt its core, hip hop music is defined by its distinctive rhythms, often characterized by sampling, turntablism, and beat-making. Early pioneers like DJ Kool Herc, Afrika Bambaataa, and Grandmaster Flash laid the groundwork, setting the stage for a genre that would soon explode into mainstream consciousness. They utilized breakbeats from funk and disco records, creating energizing dance tracks for parties. This innovative approach formed the bedrock of what we now recognize as hip hop.\n\nAs the genre expanded throughout the 1980s and 1990s, artists began utilizing hip hop as a medium for storytelling and political expression. The emergence of conscious rap, exemplified by groups like Public Enemy and artists like KRS-One, highlighted issues such as racial inequality, poverty, and systemic injustice. Their lyrics became a powerful tool for activism, pushing listeners to engage with societal issues and consider the sociopolitical context surrounding them.\n\nHip hop is also characterized by its regional diversity, resulting in various sub-genres that reflect the cultural differences in different areas. The West Coast sound, epitomized by artists like Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg, focused on laid-back beats and gangsta rap narratives, while the South introduced a new aesthetic with crunk and trap music, championed by figures like T.I. and Lil Wayne. The East Coast meanwhile leaned towards lyrical complexity and storytelling, with icons like Nas and The Notorious B.I.G. leading the charge.\n\nIn the 2000s and beyond, hip hop experienced a renaissance driven by the internet and social media. Platforms like YouTube and SoundCloud enabled emerging artists to share their work without traditional gatekeepers, democratizing the music industry. This led to a surge of new voices, such as Chance the Rapper, Kendrick Lamar, and Cardi B, who have pushed the boundaries of the genre, incorporating elements from R&B, pop, and electronic music while retaining the essence of hip hop's emotional and narrative depth.\n\nToday, hip hop influences a broad spectrum of music styles and cultural practices. It shapes fashion, language, and art, transcending its origins and becoming a global phenomenon. Lyrics often address themes of resilience and empowerment, echoing the experiences of marginalized communities while appealing to a diverse audience. The impact of hip hop is evident not only in mainstream music charts but also in how it has transformed societal conversations surrounding race, identity, and inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, hip hop music is a multifaceted genre that has grown from a localized cultural movement into a global powerhouse. Its rich history, varied styles, and enduring relevance make it one of the most significant artistic expressions of our time, reflecting the complexities of life while continuously pushing the boundaries of creativity and innovation.",

        "title": "The Beatles",
        "wikipedia_text": "The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. The core lineup of the band comprised John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. They are widely regarded as the most influential band in Western popular music and were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and the recognition of popular music as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock 'n' roll, their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways. The band also explored music styles ranging from folk and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.\n\nLed by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, the Beatles evolved from Lennon's previous group, the Quarrymen, and built their reputation by playing clubs in Liverpool and Hamburg, Germany, starting in 1960, initially with Stuart Sutcliffe playing bass. The core trio of Lennon, McCartney and Harrison, together since 1958, went through a succession of drummers, including Pete Best, before inviting Starr to join them in 1962. Manager Brian Epstein moulded them into a professional act, and producer George Martin developed their recordings, greatly expanding their domestic success after they signed with EMI and achieved their first hit, \"Love Me Do\", in late 1962. As their popularity grew into the intense fan frenzy dubbed \"Beatlemania\", the band acquired the nickname \"the Fab Four\". Epstein, Martin or other members of the band's entourage were sometimes informally referred to as a \"fifth Beatle\".\n\nBy early 1964, the Beatles were international stars and had achieved unprecedented levels of critical and commercial success. They became a leading force in Britain's cultural resurgence, ushering in the British Invasion of the United States pop market. They soon made their film debut with A Hard Day's Night (1964). A growing desire to refine their studio efforts, coupled with the challenging nature of their concert tours, led to the band's retirement from live performances in 1966. During this time, they produced albums of greater sophistication, including Rubber Soul (1965), Revolver (1966) and Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (1967). They enjoyed further commercial success with The Beatles (also known as \"the White Album\", 1968) and Abbey Road (1969). The success of these records heralded the album era, increased public interest in psychedelic drugs and Eastern spirituality, and furthered advancements in electronic music, album art and music videos. In 1968, they founded Apple Corps, a multi-armed multimedia corporation that continues to oversee projects related to the band's legacy. After the group's break-up in 1970, all principal former members enjoyed success as solo artists, and some partial reunions occurred. Lennon was murdered in 1980, and Harrison died of lung cancer in 2001. McCartney and Starr remain musically active.",

Comprised of John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr, this quartet revolutionized the music landscape in the 1960s and set the stage for modern pop and rock music.\n\nThe Beatles’ story began when John Lennon formed a skiffle group called The Quarrymen, which later evolved into The Beatles with the addition of McCartney and Harrison. Their catchy melodies, innovative songwriting, and charming personalities quickly won over audiences. They began to gain local fame in Liverpool's club scene, particularly at The Cavern Club. By 1962, they had secured a recording contract with EMI, and their first single, “Love Me Do,” achieved modest success.\n\nHowever, it was their subsequent hits that catapulted them to international stardom. Songs like \"Please Please Me,\" \"She Loves You,\" and \"I Want to Hold Your Hand\" ignited Beatlemania—a cultural phenomenon characterized by fervent fan adoration. In 1964, The Beatles made their historic appearance on \"The Ed Sullivan Show,\" which introduced them to millions of American viewers, further cementing their status as global icons.\n\nThe Beatles' music was revolutionary, blending various genres—from rock and roll and pop to folk and even experimental sounds. Their innovative studio techniques, particularly during the later years, reshaped the recording industry. Albums like \"Rubber Soul,\" \"Revolver,\" and \"Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band\" showcased their growth as artists. \"Sgt. Pepper,\" released in 1967, is often hailed as one of the greatest albums of all time, noted for its conceptual approach, elaborate production, and psychotropic influences.\n\nLyrically, The Beatles pushed boundaries, tackling themes of love, existentialism, and social change. Their song \"All You Need Is Love\" became an anthem for the counterculture movement of the 1960s, reflecting the era's desire for peace and freedom. The band was not afraid to experiment, incorporating unconventional instruments and sounds, as evidenced in tracks like \"Tomorrow Never Knows\" and \"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.\"\n\nHowever, the band's journey was not without its challenges. Tensions surfaced as individual artistic ambitions grew, leading to differing creative directions. Despite this, The Beatles produced timeless masterpieces like \"The White Album\" and \"Abbey Road\" before disbanding in 1970. Each member pursued successful solo careers, with Lennon and McCartney particularly noted for their prolific songwriting.\n\nThe Beatles' impact extended beyond music; they influenced fashion, film, and youth culture. They became symbols of the 1960s cultural revolution and left an indelible mark on the world. Their music continues to resonate with audiences today, as new generations discover the beauty of their melodies and the depth of their lyrics.\n\nIn summary, The Beatles stand as a monumental force in music history. Their innovative spirit, artistry, and cultural significance have solidified their legacy as one of the greatest bands of all time. Even decades after their breakup, their music continues to inspire, captivate, and unite fans around the globe.",

        "wikipedia_text": "Jazz is a music genre that originated in the African-American communities of New Orleans, Louisiana, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with its roots in blues, ragtime, European harmony, African rhythmic rituals, spirituals, hymns, marches, vaudeville song, and dance music. Since the 1920s Jazz Age, it has been recognized as a major form of musical expression in traditional and popular music. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, complex chords, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation.\n\nAs jazz spread around the world, it drew on national, regional, and local musical cultures, which gave rise to different styles. New Orleans jazz began in the early 1910s, combining earlier brass band marches, French quadrilles, biguine, ragtime and blues with collective polyphonic improvisation. However, jazz did not begin as a single musical tradition in New Orleans or elsewhere. In the 1930s, arranged dance-oriented swing big bands, Kansas City jazz (a hard-swinging, bluesy, improvisational style), and gypsy jazz (a style that emphasized musette waltzes) were the prominent styles. Bebop emerged in the 1940s, shifting jazz from danceable popular music toward a more challenging \"musician's music\" which was played at faster tempos and used more chord-based improvisation. Cool jazz developed near the end of the 1940s, introducing calmer, smoother sounds and long, linear melodic lines.\n\nThe mid-1950s saw the emergence of hard bop, which introduced influences from rhythm and blues, gospel, and blues to small groups and particularly to saxophone and piano. Modal jazz developed in the late 1950s, using the mode, or musical scale, as the basis of musical structure and improvisation, as did free jazz, which explored playing without regular meter, beat and formal structures. Jazz-rock fusion appeared in the late 1960s and early 1970s, combining jazz improvisation with rock music's rhythms, electric instruments, and highly amplified stage sound. In the early 1980s, a commercial form of jazz fusion called smooth jazz became successful, garnering significant radio airplay. Other styles and genres abound in the 21st century, such as Latin and Afro-Cuban jazz.",

It is characterized by its unique blend of African rhythms, blues, and European musical traditions. This genre takes a significant place in the cultural landscape of the United States and has influenced countless artists worldwide.\n\nAt its core, jazz is about improvisation, allowing musicians to express their emotions and creativity spontaneously. This element of freedom sets jazz apart from many other musical forms. Instruments typical in jazz include the saxophone, trumpet, piano, double bass, and drums, each contributing to the genre's rich tapestry. One of the most celebrated styles within jazz is bebop, which emerged in the 1940s and is known for its fast tempos and complex chord progressions.\n\nProminent figures in jazz history include legends like Louis Armstrong, whose innovative trumpet playing and gravelly voice brought the genre to a wider audience, and Duke Ellington, a brilliant composer and bandleader whose orchestral arrangements expanded the possibilities of jazz music. Billie Holiday, a stunning vocalist, used her emotional depth to evoke powerful narratives in her songs.\n\nJazz has evolved through many styles over the decades, including cool jazz, hard bop, and free jazz, each reflecting the cultural and social changes of the times. The genre is not merely confined to the United States; it has transcended borders, influencing and merging with various musical traditions globally.\n\nToday, jazz continues to evolve, with contemporary artists experimenting with new sounds while paying homage to the genre's rich heritage.

They typically incorporate a recommender system to help users discover other songs they may enjoy based on their listening history and other factors, as well as the ability to create and share public playlists with other users. It may also include customized radio or social media platforms.\n\nStreaming services saw a significant pace of growth during the 2010s, overtaking digital downloading as the largest source of revenue in the United States music industry in 2015, and accounting for a majority since 2016. As a result of its ascendance, streaming services (along with streams of music-related content on video sharing platforms), were incorporated into the methodologies of major record charts; the \"album-equivalent unit\" was also developed as an alternative metric for the consumption of albums, to account for digital music and streaming. It has also caused a cultural shift for consumers renting rather than buying music outright.\n\nConsumers moving away from traditional physical media towards streaming platforms attributed convenience, variety, and affordability as advantages. On the contrary, streaming has also been criticized by some artists for making them earn less from their music and artistry compared to physical formats, especially with pay-per-stream systems.

The more modern form of the genre, originally termed \"rap dance\", emerged with the formation of the hip hop boy band Seo Taiji and Boys, in 1992. Their experimentation with different styles and genres of music and integration of foreign musical elements helped reshape and modernize South Korea's contemporary music scene.

        "wikipedia_text": "A video game console is an electronic device that outputs a video signal or image to display a video game that can typically be played with a game controller. These may be home consoles, which are generally placed in a permanent location connected to a television or other display devices and controlled with a separate game controller, or handheld consoles, which include their own display unit and controller functions built into the unit and which can be played anywhere. Hybrid consoles combine elements of both home and handheld consoles.\n\nVideo game consoles are a specialized form of a home computer geared towards video game playing, designed with affordability and accessibility to the general public in mind, but lacking in raw computing power and customization. Simplicity is achieved in part through the use of game cartridges or other simplified methods of distribution, easing the effort of launching a game. However, this leads to ubiquitous proprietary formats that create competition for market share. More recent consoles have shown further confluence with home computers, making it easy for developers to release games on multiple platforms. Further, modern consoles can serve as replacements for media players with capabilities to play films and music from optical media or streaming media services.\n\nVideo game consoles are usually sold on a five–seven year cycle called a generation, with consoles made with similar technical capabilities or made around the same time period grouped into one generation. The industry has developed a razor and blades model: manufacturers often sell consoles at low prices, sometimes at a loss, while primarily making a profit from the licensing fees for each game sold. Planned obsolescence then draws consumers into buying the next console generation. While numerous manufacturers have come and gone in the history of the console market, there have always been two or three dominant leaders in the market, with the current market led by Sony (with their PlayStation brand), Microsoft (with their Xbox brand), and Nintendo (currently producing the Switch console). Previous console developers include Sega, Atari, Coleco, Mattel, NEC, SNK, Fujitsu, and 3DO.",
        "ai_text": "Video game consoles have revolutionized the way we experience interactive entertainment, evolving significantly since their inception. From the early days of the Atari and the NES to the latest models such as the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, these devices have transformed living rooms into immersive gaming hubs.\n\nAt their core, video game consoles are specialized computers designed for playing games. They typically consist of a central processing unit (CPU), graphics processing unit (GPU), memory, and storage, all optimized for gaming performance. Modern consoles boast impressive specifications that allow for stunning graphics, complex gameplay mechanics, and seamless online multiplayer experiences.\n\nOne of the key features of contemporary consoles is their ability to support a vast library of games, ranging from casual indie titles to blockbuster franchises. This diversity caters to a wide audience, from casual gamers to hardcore enthusiasts. Services like Sony’s PlayStation Network and Microsoft’s Game Pass further enhance the gaming experience by offering subscription models that provide access to a rotating selection of games, making it easier for players to discover new content.\n\nIn addition to gaming, modern consoles have become multimedia centers. They allow users to stream movies, music, and even browse the internet, providing a comprehensive entertainment experience. This multifunctionality has made consoles an integral part of many households.\n\nThe social aspect of gaming has also flourished with the advent of online multiplayer. Players can connect with friends and strangers worldwide, collaborating or competing in real-time. Features like voice chat, communities, and live events have contributed to making gaming a shared experience that transcends boundaries.\n\nHowever, the landscape of gaming is continuously changing. The rise of cloud gaming and mobile platforms poses challenges for traditional consoles, prompting manufacturers to innovate and adapt. The future of video game consoles will likely focus on enhanced connectivity, virtual reality, and increasingly immersive experiences, ensuring that they remain at the forefront of entertainment technology for years to come.",

The excitement surrounding the potential of e-commerce led to skyrocketing stock prices for companies like Amazon, eBay, and Pets.com, despite their unproven business models. \n\nAs venture capitalists and retail investors rushed to capitalize on the digital revolution, the market became increasingly detached from reality. Many companies went public with inflated valuations, luring in eager investors. However, by early 2000, the bubble began to burst as many dot-com firms failed to generate profit or sustain growth. The NASDAQ index, heavily weighted with tech stocks, plummeted, leading to one of the largest market crashes in history. The aftermath saw significant financial losses, company bankruptcies, and a long-term reevaluation of technology investments, ultimately reshaping the landscape of the tech industry.",

The pandemic led to governments providing an unprecedented amount of stimulus, and was also a factor in the 2021–2022 global energy crisis and 2022–2023 food crises.\n\nThe pandemic affected worldwide economic activity, resulting in a 7% drop in global commercial commerce in 2020. Several demand and supply mismatches caused by the pandemic resurfaced throughout the recovery period in 2021 and 2022 and were spread internationally through trade. During the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, businesses lost 25% of their revenue and 11% of their workforce, with contact-intensive sectors and SMEs being particularly heavily impacted. However, considerable policy assistance helped to avert large-scale bankruptcies, with just 4% of enterprises declaring for insolvency or permanently shutting at the time of the COVID-19 wave.\n\nAmidst the recovery and containment, the world economic system was characterized as experiencing significant, broad uncertainty. Economic forecasts and consensus among macroeconomics experts show significant disagreement on the overall extent, long-term effects and projected recovery. A large general increase in prices was attributed to the pandemic.

        "wikipedia_text": "Globalization is the process of increasing interdependence and integration among the economies, markets, societies, and cultures of different countries worldwide. This is made possible by the reduction of barriers to international trade, the liberalization of capital movements, the development of transportation, and the advancement of information and communication technologies. The term globalization first appeared in the early 20th century (supplanting an earlier French term mondialisation), developed its current meaning sometime in the second half of the 20th century, and came into popular use in the 1990s to describe the unprecedented international connectivity of the post–Cold War world. The origins of globalization can be traced back to the 18th and 19th centuries, driven by advances in transportation and communication technologies. These developments increased global interactions, fostering the growth of international trade and the exchange of ideas, beliefs, and cultures. While globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration, it is also closely linked to social and cultural dynamics. Additionally, disputes and international diplomacy have played significant roles in the history and evolution of globalization, continuing to shape its modern form.\n\nEconomically, globalization involves goods, services, data, technology, and the economic resources of capital. The expansion of global markets liberalizes the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds. Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible. Advances in transportation, like the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships, and developments in telecommunication infrastructure such as the telegraph, the Internet, mobile phones, and smartphones, have been major factors in globalization and have generated further interdependence of economic and cultural activities around the globe.\n\nThough many scholars place the origins of globalization in modern times, others trace its history to long before the European Age of Discovery and voyages to the New World, and some even to the third millennium BCE. Large-scale globalization began in the 1820s, and in the late 19th century and early 20th century drove a rapid expansion in the connectivity of the world's economies and cultures. The term global city was subsequently popularized by sociologist Saskia Sassen in her work The Global City: New York, London, Tokyo (1991).",
        "ai_text": "Globalization is a multifaceted phenomenon that has increasingly defined the modern world. It refers to the interconnectedness and interdependence of economies, cultures, and populations across the globe, facilitated by advancements in technology, transportation, and communication. Spanning various domains, globalization affects trade, politics, culture, and the environment, thus reshaping the dynamics of societies worldwide.\n\nEconomically, globalization has led to an unprecedented increase in global trade and investment. Businesses can now source materials and labor from across the planet, leading to more competitive markets and lower prices for consumers. This economic integration has enabled countries to specialize in industries where they hold comparative advantages, fostering innovation and efficiency. However, it has also resulted in significant challenges, such as job displacement in certain sectors, wage pressures, and the increasing power of multinational corporations, which can overshadow local businesses.\n\nCulturally, globalization has facilitated the exchange of ideas, values, and traditions, leading to a rich tapestry of cultural interactions. This cross-cultural exchange can enhance understanding and appreciation among different societies. However, it can also spur concerns over cultural homogenization, where dominant cultures overshadow local customs and practices, potentially leading to a loss of cultural identity.\n\nPolitically, globalization has encouraged cooperation among nations to address global issues, such as climate change, pandemics, and terrorism. International organizations, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, play pivotal roles in mediating relations and fostering collaboration. Yet, the increasing interconnectedness of political systems has also given rise to tensions, as countries grapple with issues of sovereignty and regulation in a globalized framework.\n\nMoreover, the environmental implications of globalization cannot be overlooked. The transportation and production processes that underpin global commerce significantly contribute to carbon emissions and environmental degradation. Addressing these challenges requires collaborative efforts across borders, highlighting the need for sustainable practices that consider the health of the planet.\n\nIn summary, globalization is a complex and evolving process that brings both opportunities and challenges. As societies navigate this intricate landscape, it is essential to balance economic growth, cultural preservation, political stability, and environmental sustainability to foster a truly inclusive global community.",

        "title": "Universal basic income",
        "wikipedia_text": "Universal basic income (UBI) is a social welfare proposal in which all citizens of a given population regularly receive a minimum income in the form of an unconditional transfer payment, i.e., without a means test or need to perform work. In contrast, a guaranteed minimum income is paid only to those who do not already receive an income that is enough to live on. A UBI would be received independently of any other income. If the level is sufficient to meet a person's basic needs (i.e., at or above the poverty line), it is sometimes called a full basic income; if it is less than that amount, it may be called a partial basic income. As of 2025, no country has implemented a full UBI system, but two countries—Mongolia and Iran—have had a partial UBI in the past. There have been numerous pilot projects, and the idea is discussed in many countries. Some have labelled UBI as utopian due to its historical origin.\n\nThere are several welfare arrangements that can be considered similar to basic income, although they are not unconditional. Many countries have a system of child benefit, which is essentially a basic income for guardians of children. A pension may be a basic income for retired persons. There are also quasi-basic income programs that are limited to certain population groups or time periods, like Bolsa Familia in Brazil, which is concentrated on the poor, or the Thamarat Program in Sudan, which was introduced by the transitional government to ease the effects of the economic crisis inherited from the Bashir regime. Likewise, the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted some countries to send direct payments to its citizens. The Alaska Permanent Fund is a fund for all residents of the U.S. state of Alaska which averages $1,600 annually (in 2019 currency), and is sometimes described as the only example of a real basic income in practice. A negative income tax (NIT) can be viewed as a basic income for certain income groups in which citizens receive less and less money until this effect is reversed the more a person earns.\n\nCritics claim that a basic income at an appropriate level for all citizens is not financially feasible, fear that the introduction of a basic income would lead to fewer people working, and/or consider it socially unjust that everyone should receive the same amount of money regardless of their individual needs. Proponents say it is indeed financeable, arguing that such a system, instead of many individual means-tested social benefits, would eliminate much more expensive social administration and bureaucratic efforts, and expect that unattractive jobs would have to be better paid and their working conditions improved because there would have to be an incentive to do them when already receiving an income, which would increase the willingness to work. Advocates also argue that a basic income is fair because it ensures that everyone has a sufficient financial basis to build on and less financial pressure, thus allowing people to find work that suits their interests and strengths.",
        "ai_text": "Universal Basic Income (UBI) has emerged as a significant topic of discussion among economists, policymakers, and social activists in recent years. At its core, UBI is a model of social security in which all citizens receive a consistent, unconditional cash payment from the government, regardless of other income, wealth, or employment status. This concept has gained traction as societies grapple with economic inequalities, job displacement due to automation, and the evolving nature of work.\n\nThe principle behind UBI is remarkably straightforward: it aims to provide individuals with a financial safety net that ensures their basic needs—such as food, shelter, and healthcare—are met, thus fostering a sense of security and dignity. Proponents argue that income security can lead to greater creativity and innovation by freeing individuals from the constant struggle for survival. Imagine a world where people could pursue education, start businesses, or engage in community projects without the immediate pressure of making ends meet. Such an environment could potentially nudge society toward more fulfilling pursuits and reduce the anxiety often associated with financial instability.\n\nOne of the primary arguments in favor of UBI is its potential to reduce poverty and inequality. In countries where wealth disparity is rampant, direct cash payments can empower the most vulnerable segments of society, allowing them to make choices that enhance their quality of life. Studies conducted in various pilot programs around the world, from Finland to Kenya to California, suggest that receiving a basic income leads to improvements in health, well-being, and overall life satisfaction. Enhanced purchasing power can stimulate local economies as recipients spend their income on goods and services, further energizing communities.\n\nHowever, UBI is not without its critics. Detractors raise concerns about the financial sustainability of the program, arguing that the costs could be astronomical. Implementing a UBI might require significant tax increases or reallocating funds from other social services, which could be politically controversial. Moreover, skeptics question whether providing unconditional income might disincentivize work, potentially leading to a decrease in labor participation rates. They argue that a balance must be struck between safeguarding citizens’ income and encouraging productive engagement in the workforce.\n\nDespite these concerns, UBI offers an innovative approach to addressing 21st-century challenges. As automation and artificial intelligence continue to disrupt traditional job markets, many fear an economic future where employment opportunities become scarce for large segments of the population.

        "wikipedia_text": "The history of timekeeping devices dates back to when ancient civilizations first observed astronomical bodies as they moved across the sky. Devices and methods for keeping time have gradually improved through a series of new inventions, starting with measuring time by continuous processes, such as the flow of liquid in water clocks, to mechanical clocks, and eventually repetitive, oscillatory processes, such as the swing of pendulums. Oscillating timekeepers are used in modern timepieces.\n\nSundials and water clocks were first used in ancient Egypt c. 1200 BC and later by the Babylonians, the Greeks and the Chinese. Incense clocks were being used in China by the 6th century. In the medieval period, Islamic water clocks were unrivalled in their sophistication until the mid-14th century. The hourglass, invented in Europe, was one of the few reliable methods of measuring time at sea.\n\nIn medieval Europe, purely mechanical clocks were developed after the invention of the bell-striking alarm, used to signal the correct time to ring monastic bells. The weight-driven mechanical clock controlled by the action of a verge and foliot was a synthesis of earlier ideas from European and Islamic science. Mechanical clocks were a major breakthrough, one notably designed and built by Henry de Vick in c. 1360, which established basic clock design for the next 300 years. Minor developments were added, such as the invention of the mainspring in the early 15th century, which allowed small clocks to be built for the first time.",
        "ai_text": "The history of timekeeping devices is a fascinating journey that spans thousands of years, reflecting humanity's quest to understand and measure time. The earliest timekeeping methods can be traced back to ancient civilizations, where sundials and water clocks were employed. The sundial, used by the Egyptians around 1500 BC, relied on the sun's position to cast a shadow that indicated the time of day. Similarly, the water clock, or clepsydra, measured time through the regulated flow of water.\n\nAs civilization progressed, so did timekeeping technology. The mechanical clock emerged in the Middle Ages, marking a significant leap forward. Initially, these clocks were large, cumbersome devices that relied on gears and weights, often found in church towers. By the 14th century, the first mechanical clocks appeared in Europe, bringing a more reliable method of timekeeping.\n\nThe invention of the pendulum clock by Christiaan Huygens in 1656 drastically improved accuracy, achieving remarkable precision. This development paved the way for more sophisticated timekeeping devices, including the marine chronometer in the 18th century, which was essential for navigation at sea.\n\nIn the 20th century, the introduction of quartz clocks and atomic clocks revolutionized timekeeping, with atomic clocks providing unparalleled accuracy. Today, we rely on a complex network of technologies, including GPS satellites, to keep time with incredible precision. The evolution of timekeeping reflects not only advancements in technology but also humanity's enduring desire to measure and understand the passage of time.",

        "title": "Conspiracy theory",
        "wikipedia_text": "A conspiracy theory is an explanation for an event or situation that asserts the existence of a conspiracy (generally by powerful sinister groups, often political in motivation), when other explanations are more probable. The term generally has a negative connotation, implying that the appeal of a conspiracy theory is based in prejudice, emotional conviction, or insufficient evidence. A conspiracy theory is distinct from a conspiracy; it refers to a hypothesized conspiracy with specific characteristics, including but not limited to opposition to the mainstream consensus among those who are qualified to evaluate its accuracy, such as scientists or historians.\n\nConspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other; they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them. They are reinforced by circular reasoning: both evidence against the conspiracy and absence of evidence for it are misinterpreted as evidence of its truth. Stephan Lewandowsky observes \"This interpretation relies on the notion that, the stronger the evidence against a conspiracy, the more the conspirators must want people to believe their version of events.\" As a consequence, the conspiracy becomes a matter of faith rather than something that can be proven or disproven. Studies have linked belief in conspiracy theories to distrust of authority and political cynicism. Some researchers suggest that conspiracist ideation—belief in conspiracy theories—may be psychologically harmful or pathological. Such belief is correlated with psychological projection, paranoia, and Machiavellianism.\n\nPsychologists usually attribute belief in conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia, schizotypy, narcissism, and insecure attachment, or to a form of cognitive bias called \"illusory pattern perception\". It has also been linked with the so-called Dark triad personality types, whose common feature is lack of empathy. However, a 2020 review article found that most cognitive scientists view conspiracy theorizing as typically nonpathological, given that unfounded belief in conspiracy is common across both historical and contemporary cultures, and may arise from innate human tendencies towards gossip, group cohesion, and religion. One historical review of conspiracy theories concluded that \"Evidence suggests that the aversive feelings that people experience when in crisis—fear, uncertainty, and the feeling of being out of control—stimulate a motivation to make sense of the situation, increasing the likelihood of perceiving conspiracies in social situations.\"",
        "ai_text": "Conspiracy theories have become a significant component of contemporary discourse, permeating social media and public life. At their core, conspiracy theories posit that events or situations are secretly manipulated behind the scenes by powerful groups with malicious intent. These theories often emerge in response to complex societal issues or crises, providing alternative explanations to official narratives. While some conspiracy theories may seem harmless or trivial, others can have profound implications, influencing public opinion, inciting fear, and even contributing to social unrest.\n\nOne of the most critical aspects of conspiracy theories is their psychological appeal. They offer a sense of control and understanding in a world that often feels chaotic and unpredictable. For many, these theories provide clear villains and straightforward explanations for phenomena that are otherwise difficult to grasp. They also create a sense of belonging among adherents, who often see themselves as part of a select group that has uncovered hidden truths.\n\nThe rise of the internet and social media has amplified the spread of these theories, allowing them to reach large audiences quickly. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube facilitate the sharing of information, regardless of its veracity. Algorithms often promote sensational content, which can lead to echo chambers where misinformation flourishes. This environment can make it challenging to distinguish credible information from unfounded claims, further solidifying believers' resolve in their convictions.\n\nConspiracy theories often target institutions like the government, science, or the media, raising doubts about their credibility. For instance, theories surrounding the global pandemic have questioned the efficacy of vaccines, leading to public health challenges. Similarly, political conspiracies have been instrumental in polarizing societies, contributing to the erosion of trust in democratic institutions.\n\nIn response to the proliferation of conspiracy theories, there is a growing emphasis on critical thinking and media literacy. Educators, journalists, and advocates for information integrity are working to promote skepticism and discernment, encouraging individuals to question sources and seek evidence before accepting claims at face value.\n\nIn conclusion, while conspiracy theories can spark genuine curiosity and debate, they also pose risks to societal cohesion and trust. Understanding their roots and impacts can help in navigating a world increasingly shaped by misinformation and distrust.",

It is the retention of information over time for the purpose of influencing future action. If past events could not be remembered, it would be impossible for language, relationships, or personal identity to develop. Memory loss is usually described as forgetfulness or amnesia.\n\nMemory is often understood as an informational processing system with explicit and implicit functioning that is made up of a sensory processor, short-term (or working) memory, and long-term memory. This can be related to the neuron.\n\nThe sensory processor allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli and attended to various levels of focus and intent. Working memory serves as an encoding and retrieval processor. Information in the form of stimuli is encoded in accordance with explicit or implicit functions by the working memory processor. The working memory also retrieves information from previously stored material. Finally, the function of long-term memory is to store through various categorical models or systems.",
        "ai_text": "Memory is a fascinating and complex function of the human mind, serving as the repository of our experiences, knowledge, and identity. In the early 19th century, philosophical inquiries into memory began to intertwine with emerging scientific understandings. Thinkers such as John Locke posited that memory is essential for personal identity, suggesting that our continuity is tied to our ability to recall past experiences. At the same time, advances in neuroscience began to reveal the anatomical basis of memory, linking it to structures like the hippocampus.\n\nMemory can be divided into various types: short-term, which allows us to hold information temporarily, and long-term, which stores information for extended periods. The processes of encoding, storage, and retrieval are fundamental to how we utilize memory in our daily lives. However, it is not infallible; memories can be distorted or forgotten, leading to the phenomenon of false memories. As societal changes and technological advancements continue to affect how we store and recall information, understanding the intricacies of memory remains a vital pursuit within psychology and cognitive science, allowing us to grasp not only how we remember but also what it means to be human.",

        "wikipedia_text": "In astronomy, dark matter is an invisible and hypothetical form of matter that does not interact with light or other electromagnetic radiation. Dark matter is implied by gravitational effects which cannot be explained by general relativity unless more matter is present than can be observed. Such effects occur in the context of formation and evolution of galaxies, gravitational lensing, the observable universe's current structure, mass position in galactic collisions, the motion of galaxies within galaxy clusters, and cosmic microwave background anisotropies. Dark matter is thought to serve as gravitational scaffolding for cosmic structures.\n\nAfter the Big Bang, dark matter clumped into blobs along narrow filaments with superclusters of galaxies forming a cosmic web at scales on which entire galaxies appear like tiny particles.\n\nIn the standard Lambda-CDM model of cosmology, the mass–energy content of the universe is 5% ordinary matter, 26.8% dark matter, and 68.2% a form of energy known as dark energy. Thus, dark matter constitutes 85% of the total mass, while dark energy and dark matter constitute 95% of the total mass–energy content. While the density of dark matter is significant in the halo around a galaxy, its local density in the Solar System is much less than normal matter. The total of all the dark matter out to the orbit of Neptune would add up about 10^17 kg, the same as a large asteroid.",
        "ai_text": "Dark matter is an enigmatic substance that constitutes approximately 27% of the universe's total mass-energy content, yet remains largely invisible and undetectable by conventional means. Unlike ordinary matter, which comprises stars, planets, and living organisms and interacts with electromagnetic forces, dark matter does not emit, absorb, or reflect light. This makes it exceedingly challenging to study directly. Instead, its existence is inferred through its gravitational effects on visible matter and cosmic structures.\n\nThe evidence for dark matter arises from several key observations, such as the rotation curves of galaxies, which suggest that galaxies possess much more mass than what can be seen. Additionally, the gravitational lensing phenomena—where light from distant stars is bent around massive objects—further supports its presence. The cosmic microwave background radiation also hints at the influence of dark matter in the early universe's formation.\n\nDespite extensive research, the exact nature of dark matter remains unknown. Several candidates have been proposed, including Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) and axions, yet none have been conclusively detected. Understanding dark matter is crucial for unlocking the mysteries of the universe, as it plays a fundamental role in cosmic evolution, structure formation, and ultimately, our grasp of fundamental physics.

In this view, the epithet \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\" is a descriptive label that refers to an event's positivity, negativity, or improbability.\n\nSupernatural interpretations of luck consider it to be an attribute of a person or object, or the result of a favorable or unfavorable view of a deity upon a person.  These interpretations often prescribe how luckiness or unluckiness can be obtained, such as by carrying a lucky charm or offering sacrifices or prayers to a deity. Saying someone is \"born lucky\" may hold different meanings, depending on the interpretation: it could simply mean that they have been born into a good family or circumstance; or that they habitually experience improbably positive events, due to some inherent property, or due to the lifelong favor of a god or goddess in a monotheistic or polytheistic religion.\n\nMany superstitions are related to luck, though these are often specific to a given culture or set of related cultures, and sometimes contradictory.  For example, lucky symbols include the number 7 in Christian-influenced cultures and the number 8 in Chinese-influenced cultures.  Unlucky symbols and events include entering and leaving a house by different doors or breaking a mirror in Greek culture, throwing rocks into a whirlwind in Navajo culture, and ravens in Western culture. Some of these associations may derive from related facts or desires.  For example, in Western culture opening an umbrella indoors might be considered unlucky partly because it could poke someone in the eye, whereas shaking hands with a chimney sweep might be considered lucky partly because it is a kind but unpleasant thing to do given the dirty nature of their work. In Chinese  and Japanese culture, the association of the number 4 as a homophone with the word for death may explain why it is considered unlucky.  Extremely complicated and sometimes contradictory systems for prescribing auspicious and inauspicious times and arrangements of things have been devised, for example feng shui in Chinese culture and systems of astrology in various cultures around the world.",
        "ai_text": "Luck is a concept that has fascinated humanity for centuries, often perceived as a force that influences the outcomes of our lives in ways that transcend our control. It embodies the whims of chance, the unpredictable intersections of fate, and the serendipitous moments that can alter our paths. While some view luck as a mere coincidence, others imbue it with profound significance, attributing successes and failures to its capricious nature.\n\nHistorically, cultures across the globe have crafted intricate beliefs and practices surrounding luck. In many societies, certain symbols—like four-leaf clovers, horseshoes, or lucky numbers—are believed to draw positive fortune. Rituals may be performed to appease the gods or spirits of luck, reflecting a deep-rooted desire to influence the uncontrollable aspects of life. Conversely, the fear of bad luck has led to superstitions that caution against certain actions, such as breaking mirrors or opening umbrellas indoors. These age-old beliefs underscore a universal human yearning for security and predictability in a chaotic world.\n\nHowever, the relationship between luck and success is complex. While luck can certainly play a role in creating opportunities, it is often intertwined with preparation and perseverance. The well-known adage “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity” captures this idea perfectly. Many successful individuals attribute their achievements not solely to luck but to hard work, resilience, and the ability to seize favorable circumstances when they arise. This perspective suggests that while luck may open doors, it is our efforts that ultimately allow us to walk through them.\n\nIn contemporary discourse, especially within the realms of psychology and personal development, the notion of luck is continually evolving. Some argue that adopting a “lucky mindset” can enhance one’s perception of the world, encouraging optimism and openness to new experiences. It suggests that individuals can cultivate their own luck by fostering positive relationships, seeking new opportunities, and embracing challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, luck remains a multifaceted concept that straddles the line between fate and personal agency. While it can influence the direction of our lives in unexpected ways, our responses to luck and our willingness to take risks often determine the true impact it has on our journey. Ultimately, luck, like life itself, is an intricate tapestry woven from threads of chance, choice, and hard-earned wisdom.",
